            The Los Angeles
 Times , USA
 Today , and the Wall
 Street Journal (in its "Business and Finance" box) lead with the stock
 market's biggest plunge in over a year--a story off-leaded by the New York Times and Washington Post. The Nasdaq
 index fell 5.6 percent (after gaining 86 percent in 1999) and the Dow fell 3.2
 percent (after gaining 25 in '99). Analysts attribute the sell-off to tax
 incentives arriving with the new year and to heightened fears of an
 interest-rate hike when the Federal Reserve Board meets on Feb. 1. The
 NYT and Post lead with President Clinton's announcement that
 he will nominate Alan Greenspan for a fourth four-year term as chairman of the
 Fed. USAT and the LAT mention Clinton's announcement in their
 stock-market leads, while the Journal puts it fourth from the top in
 its "Business and Finance" box.

 The Journal says that Clinton's announcement "mak[es] official what
 markets had been expecting and what politicians from both parties had been
 endorsing for months." The Post , however, writes that "some participants in the financial markets had
 begun to speculate that Clinton might not reappoint [Greenspan], or that the
 administration would try to influence Fed interest-rate policy in exchange for
 the reappointment." So, are the market dip and Greenspan's appointment related?
 Yes and no: While Wall Street analysts laud Clinton's move, his announcement frees Greenspan from
 political pressure to keep rates down. But the papers also blame the sell-off
 on tax laws--capital gains earned now are not taxed until April 2001--and an
 overvalued technology sector.

 USAT 's stock-market story describes the Nasdaq's drop as "breathtaking" but goes on to note
 that it was "long overdue" and only the eighth-largest percentage drop in the
 index's history. Both USAT and the Post begin a paragraph with the same hackneyed
 sentence: "The carnage was widespread.
