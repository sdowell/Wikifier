            Dear Tony,

            Why these books, why now? Boy, that's a hard one. Could be a simple matter
 of demographics: Boomers' kids are old enough to know what they like and say
 so, and there are enough of them to give their collective voice a certain
 volume. Or maybe it's a cyclical thing: Fantasy was last in fashion during the
 '70s, when (as you point out) Star Wars had its astonishing apotheosis.
 Is it coming back like platform shoes? Or maybe the explanation is Rowling's
 quick, enchanted pen--she's turned out three Potter stories in two years,
 leaving her readers no time to lose their appetites. Or could it be our
 ambivalence about the recent furious surge of moody technology, giving us
 apparently magical powers that we can't quite control? Or is someone at
 Scholastic a secret marketing genius? Or is Rowling herself a wizard? What's
 your pet theory?

            I wonder whether it's true, as you claim, that children are less likely than
 adults to put up with being preached at. The authors of children's books on the
 whole certainly don't seem to think so. Classics like Little Women and
 The Secret Garden preach shamelessly without losing their passionate
 young groupies, even today. Kids, after all, get plenty of lectures
 ("discipline," "limits") from their beloved parents. The more recent crop of
 books continue to preach, though they promote psychological health rather than
 moral rectitude. American writers are far worse in this respect than the
 Brits--even Konigsberg and Fitzhugh, whom I love as you do, can occasionally
 sound like guidance counselors. Maybe one of the reasons Rowling hit it big
 with grown-ups is her refusal to drum in lessons. Instead, her books get their
 depth from a combination of allegory and genuine human interactions that
 haven't been pre-chewed. She lets her characters learn from their mistakes (or
 fail to do so).
