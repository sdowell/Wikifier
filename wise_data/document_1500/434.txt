            In the wake of American Home Products' friendly bid for Warner-Lambert and
 Pfizer's $80 billion (or $74 billion, depending on who's counting) hostile
 counter-offer (click here to

 going to see a wave of mergers in the pharmaceutical industry. Novartis, Glaxo,
 Monsanto, Schering-Plough, Merck: Everyone is either on the block or shopping.
 Whether all this buying and selling makes economic sense seems somehow beside
 the point. After all, they don't call it merger- mania for nothing.

            The most perplexing thing about the goings-on in the pharmaceutical
 industry, though, is not that drug-company CEOs would rather run $70 billion
 companies rather than $30 billion companies. Nor is it that Pfizer's
 bid--which, remember, it could have made long before American Home Products
 came a-courting--seems driven as much by the "if you want Warner-Lambert, then
 I want Warner-Lambert" impulse as anything else. These, after all, are the
 basic ingredients of many, if not most, mergers which has something to do with
 the fact that most mergers destroy, and don't create, economic value.

            No, the most perplexing thing about all the merger talk is the reaction of
 investors, who have driven up the prices of pharmaceutical stocks pretty much
 across the board. Since acquisitions almost universally occur at a price above
 the current market price, and since bidding wars (of all kinds) tend to drive
 prices far above fair value, investors have jumped into the drug stocks,
 assuming that merger-mania has to be good for them.

            Here's the problem, though: There are no outside bidders for these
 companies. The only company that's going to buy a Glaxo is another drug
 company. So, there isn't any flood of outside capital coming into the drug
 industry.
