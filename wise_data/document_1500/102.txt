            Russ,

            Bust the union, indeed! I'm for unions on principle--and in practical,
 self-interested terms, the union was what allowed me to make some semblance of
 a decent living when I worked there, not to mention its role in representing a
 militant staff culture and defending the autonomy of editors and writers,
 especially in the Murdoch era--but all that aside, the union has nothing to do
 with the Voice's editorial problems. The Voice was much better in
 the '80s when the union was stronger, relatively speaking--not that it was ever
 really strong, but it seems totally toothless now. On the contrary, the
 Voice has been done in by '90s corporate culture with its emphasis on
 cost-cutting, its cult of efficiency, and its deep distrust of creative work
 because it's ultimately unquantifiable and resistant to control from the top.
 If a publication is built around writers with strong, individual views and
 identities, and people read the paper because of those writers, it gives the
 writers and editors a lot of power; and I think it has suited Leonard Stern's
 business agenda (I'm not suggesting it's a conscious conspiracy) for the
 Voice to stop being a writer's paper. Free distribution also changes the
 nature of the readership and the relationship between readers and
 writers--people aren't shelling out money to read particular writers, and it's
 harder for writers to tell who their audience is.

            A while ago I had a conversation with the Voice's managing editor in
 which he said I was one in a long line of Embittered Alumni. I thought that was
 witty, and briefly considered making up a Village Voice Embittered
 Alumni button. But in fact I'm not bitter--the Voice was where I really
 developed as a writer and editor, and I'm grateful to it, on the whole--I'm
 just frustrated: I think the paper served a crucial function as a space for
 cultural reporting and analysis and culturally radical ideas that were censored
 elsewhere, and it isn't serving that function anymore, nor has any other
 publication come close to replacing it.
