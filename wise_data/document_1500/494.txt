            Dear Gerald:

            We're probably more in accord on Africana than not, but I think you
 were too easy on Gates. Years ago, before blackness became really marketable,
 it used to be said that the publishing industry would admit only one black
 writer at a time. Langston Hughes was succeeded by Richard Wright, who in turn
 was succeeded by James Baldwin. A few years ago, we thought that notion was
 disproved when Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and Terry McMillan were
 simultaneously on the bestseller list. Then along came Henry Louis "Skip" Gates
 Jr.

            He's the modern-day impresario of black culture, the Joyce Carol Oates of
 black studies, producing with daunting regularity. James Brown used to be
 called the hardest-working man in show business, but he ain't got nothing on
 Gates.

            Would somebody puh-leeze stop him before he writes again?

            Unlike you, I don't labor in the fields of black culture, and I'm
 glad--though as a fiction writer who keeps hearing rumors that Gates is working
 on a novel, I'm constantly checking my rear-view mirror for his headlights. You
 guys are in an unenviable place. Gates must seem like he's everywhere. Still
 and all, I wonder how much of his work will survive, and whether, in a hundred
 years, say, anyone will read anything by Gates, in the same way we still read
 The Souls of Black Folk .

            Oh, well. At least Gates had the decency not to include himself in his own
 encyclopedia. Or did I miss that entry?

            I wish he'd left out bell hooks and Cornel West, though, two prominent
 public intellectuals (that's what they call people who get paid hundreds of
 thousands of dollars to lecture the rest of us about what we're doing wrong).
 There are biographies of both, though, thankfully, we only have to read
 about hooks. Not so with West. He writes a 15-page "interpretation" of
 W.
