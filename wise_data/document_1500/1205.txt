            Last week House Speaker Newt
 Gingrich proposed abolishing the estate tax. Many other Republican politicians,
 and some Democrats, have done the same.

            The estate tax is imposed on
 assets passed on to heirs when someone dies. It is the only federal tax on
 wealth --as opposed to income or consumption. Congress imposed it in
 1916, mainly motivated by Progressive Era concerns about the concentration of
 wealth in the coffers of a few families.

            The
 estate tax is progressive --that is, the tax rate is higher on larger
 estates. The first $600,000 is exempt. A couple can, therefore, pass on $1.2
 million tax-free to their heirs. The rate is 37 percent on amounts between
 $600,000 and $750,000. The highest rate is 55 percent, and kicks in at $3
 million. But any amount inherited by a spouse is exempt. Pre-death gifts
 of up to $10,000 a year per recipient are also exempt. Thus, a couple with two
 children can pass on $40,000 a year tax-free. (Lifetime gifts above the
 exempted amount are subject to the gift tax , which more or less
 parallels the estate tax.)

            

               Creative accounting also reduces the
 estate-tax burden. Deductions , which include administrative costs and
 charitable gifts, are ample. The tax is based on property's "fair market
 value ," which is a malleable concept and notoriously underestimated by
 professional estate appraisers. Squabbles between the IRS and estates over fair
 market value are routine and often protracted. Trusts and other
 complicated devices are also used to reduce the tax on large estates, although
 Congress has eliminated many of these opportunities and the IRS has been
 scrutinizing others more closely in recent years.

            The estate
 tax affects few . Last year, 69,772 estates with assets of more than
 $600,000 filed forms with the IRS. The combined value of these estates was
 $117.
