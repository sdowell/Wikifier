            Today's topic is Planet Hollywood, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a
 week ago. And today's question is: Won't someone just put this dog out of its
 misery?

            Planet Hollywood, a trailblazer in the booming field of cheesy
 celebrity-themed restaurants featuring mediocre food, has been struggling for
 almost three years now. It has reported shrinking earnings, which eventually
 turned into losses, in every quarter in the last two fiscal years. If even a
 third of the 80 restaurants it owns around the world are making money, I'd be
 shocked. And since April, the company has been in default on $250 million worth
 of junk bonds. Trading in the company's stock has been suspended, and the
 announcement of Chapter 11 means that the stock is essentially worthless. (Thus
 demonstrating the important lesson that buying a cheap stock because you're
 sure it can't go any lower is a mistake.)

            It's hard to feel sorry for either the bondholders or the stockholders,
 since this was a train wreck you could have seen coming a mile away. (Click

 an earlier piece on Planet Hollywood.) But the company's proposed restructuring
 plan is nonetheless dismaying. It keeps current management in place and hands
 over 70 percent of the equity in the company to an investor group comprising
 two of Planet Hollywood's largest shareholders for what is, relatively
 speaking, a small investment of $30 million. Current shareholders will probably
 walk away with nothing, current bondholders will get less than 50 cents on the
 dollar (and that's if everything goes perfectly), while current CEO Robert Earl
 and Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal will get most of the new company.

            Still, my dismay is contained by the fact that 70 percent of nothing is
 nothing, and in the end it seems clear that that's all Planet Hollywood is
 worth.
