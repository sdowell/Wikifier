               THEY MAY have finally found a way to neutralize Matt Drudge--make him
 famous! Since the Monica Mess broke, Drudge has apparently been so busy giving
 interviews and making television appearances that he's had no time to write his
 famed dispatches. The last one was Jan. 21...Did you notice on Meet the
 Press how Drudge's face seems to curve from top to bottom like a giant
 half-moon letter "C"? Peyronie's Disease of the chin?.... While Chatterbox
 loves Drudge (except for that nasty Sidney Blumenthal business), on TV he does
 come across as one mighty weird fellow...

            
               MUCH CHATTER about what a relaxed good mood Vice President Al Gore
 was in when he showed up at a dinner last Wednesday honoring the Associated
 Press. The Monica story had broken that morning...

            
               CHATTERBOX WAS GOING to predict that Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
 New York would be the first prominent Democrat to suggest that Clinton might
 have to resign....Really we were...But Moynihan beat us to the punch with his
 declaration in the New York Post that Clinton could not survive
 admitting an affair with Lewinsky. The Post said Moynihan's comments
 "carry special clout" because "he is one of the Senate's most respected
 members, seen as a leader on matters of ethics and values." In truth,
 Moynihan's remarks were as predictable as the sunrise. He's been getting press
 by stabbing Clinton in the back since before Clinton's election. Moynihan
 endorsed Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey against Clinton in the 1992 primary. Later he
 publicly undermined Clinton's health care plan. Then he undermined Clinton's
 welfare plan. Anyone who reads Moynihan's recent book Miles to Go will
 see he strongly dislikes, if not loathes the president. He may have good reason
 for this disdain, but it means his resignation talk doesn't carry much weight
 at all.
