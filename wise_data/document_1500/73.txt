            One of the more perplexing--actually, I'll say it's the most
 perplexing--facts about television today is that there is essentially nowhere,
 other than pay-per-view, where you can watch international soccer such as the
 European or FA Cups, let alone regular-season matches from England's Premier
 League or Italy's Serie A.

            This depressing fact has already prompted a welcome cri de coeur from

                  Slate
                contributor Michael Hirschorn in the newest Brill's
 Content , where he points out how odd it is that in the wasteland that is
 the upper reaches of the cable box, there's no room for true international
 stars like David Beckham, Ronaldo, or Davor Suker. But the paradoxical
 situation is that something that is incredibly valuable abroad--Rupert Murdoch,
 you might remember, was willing to shell out $1 billion to acquire the
 Manchester United franchise--is thought to have little or no value in the
 United States. And while we might well ask ESPN, "Wouldn't it make more sense
 to show three great international matches a week instead of six hours of
 SportsCenter reruns?," it costs ESPN nothing to run the
 SportsCenter reruns, while buying the rights to international
 matches--which are, in any case, mostly controlled by Murdoch--wouldn't
 necessarily come cheap.

            The key words here, though, are "thought to have little or no value."
 Despite the ascendance of soccer moms into American political iconography,
 despite the fact that a generation of kids has now grown up playing soccer, and
 despite the success of successive World Cups (men and women) here in 1994 and
 in 1999, the essential operating assumption of television programmers for all
 the major networks--broadcast and cable--is that no real audience for
 international soccer exists. But more and more, this seems to be a clear case
 where one of the reasons that audience has failed to materialize is because the
 opportunity for it to materialize has never existed.
