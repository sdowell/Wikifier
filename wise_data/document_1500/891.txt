            The surprise congressional resurgence of campaign reform leads at the
 Washington Post , New York Times ,
 and Los
 Angeles Times . USA Today leads with the FDA's warning about creatine, a
 muscle-building supplement widely used by athletes.

            The dailies explain that House GOP leaders agreed to allow campaign finance
 legislation to come to floor votes next month because reform advocates were
 close to getting enough signatures on a special petition to force a vote
 anyway. President Clinton is quoted saying the development was "great news,"
 but House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt is quoted saying, "This was a retreat
 not a conversion. The Republican leadership still opposes reform that reduces
 the role of money in politics." And indeed the coverage points out that the
 Senate has already defeated a ban on "soft money" once this session.

            Both the NYT and USAT fronts cover yesterday's oral arguments
 in the fourth and final sexual harassment case the Supreme Court is
 hearing this term. The issue in this one is whether a supervisor's single
 threat saying a female subordinate's sexual compliance will ease her working
 conditions constitutes harassment when her non-compliance meets with no adverse
 consequences. The issue is an ingredient in the Paula Jones case and hence the
 Court's decision here might affect her appeal. Both papers note that many of
 the justices seemed genuinely perplexed during yesterday's arguments.

            Meanwhile, the WP front observes firm differences about gender on display in the Court's 6-3
 decision to uphold the law that automatically grants U.S. citizenship to an
 out-of-wedlock child if the mother is an American, but not if only the father
 is. Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
 presumed that there is a closer connection between a mother and her child than
 between a father and his.
