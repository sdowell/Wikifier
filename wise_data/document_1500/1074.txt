            Is Chatterbox crazy to think Sidney Blumenthal didn't get enough
 favorable publicity after he was forced to appear before Kenneth Starr's grand
 jury to tell prosecutors whether he was saying nasty things about them? The
 subpoena was, after all, just as outrageous as the commentariat said it was.
 (Does Pepperdine law school really want to give its deanship to someone who
 doesn' t know the first thing about the First Amendment?) Yet when Blumenthal
 finally testified last Thursday, and then denounced Starr from the courthouse
 steps, NBC correspondent David "Excitable Boy" Bloom poisoned Blumenthal's
 sound bite by characterizing it in advance as a "tirade."... The most
 gratuitously anti-Sid coverage was the front-page sneer from John M. Broder in
 the New York Times . Broder's story began with this: "After a long career
 as a scribbler in the shadows, Sidney Blumenthal got his moment in the sun
 today... ." Now, it's true that Blumenthal was obviously loving the exposure,
 but so are about 80 percent of the people who appear in the New York
 Times . That doesn't usually get them a first-graph smirk, at least when
 there are important things at stake. Imagine the respectful tone the
 Times would have struck if, say, Erskine Bowles had been hauled before
 the grand jury. But the First Amendment issues would have been the same....
 Broder's third graph was bizarre: "A former journalist and the White House's
 most celebrated conspiracy theorist, Mr. Blumenthal faced the cameras at the
 peak of the Western Hemisphere's last total solar eclipse of the millennium."
 Chatterbox at first thought this was an adventurous metaphor for the way
 Blumenthal's story had been eclipsed by the news from Iraq, or the lull in the
 Flytrap scandal, or by Broder's own attitude. But no. Turns out it was an
 in-joke--Blumenthal is a millennium freak. You can laugh now... When is an
 in-joke too in to run?
