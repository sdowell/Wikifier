            Commenting Wednesday on
 Turkey's capture of the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, the press across
 western Europe made two principal demands: that Ocalan should not be executed,
 as Turkish law allows, and that Turkey should seize this opportunity to reach a
 peaceful settlement of its Kurdish problem. It was also generally accepted in
 both Europe and the Middle East that U.S. intelligence was deeply involved in
 Ocalan's mysterious delivery from the Greek Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, where he
 had been sheltering, to an island prison near Istanbul.

 Turkish Daily News , Ilnur Cevik wrote that Ecevit and Iraqi Vice

 international community."

            Mohammad Noureddin, a
 leading Arab expert on Turkish affairs, told the London-based Mideast Mirror
 news service Tuesday that Ocalan's "handover to Turkey by Greece via U.
