            Chris--

            You know sports are getting crazy when the Olympic movement looks tainted by
 wretched excess and the Super Bowl is actually providing the inspirational
 story of the week.

            Have you been following St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner this
 year?

            It's hard to remember another athlete who went from nowhere to his sports'
 summit in a single season, as Warner has. There was Fernando Valenzuela during
 his rookie season with the L.A. Dodgers. And Boris Becker when he won Wimbledon
 at age 17 as an unknown wild-card entry. Barry Sanders was a supermarket stock
 boy and backup running back at Oklahoma State who won the Heisman Trophy his
 first and only year as a starter.

            The only NFL example that Warner keeps getting compared to is Johnny
 Unitas.

            When I was growing up in Pittsburgh, people there still talked about how
 badly the Steelers erred when they drafted Unitas and cut him before he'd even
 played a preseason game or broke training camp with the team. Pittsburgh
 already had Jim Finks and Ted Marchibroda at quarterback then. Unitas had no
 other NFL takers, so he played semi-pro football with a Pittsburgh sandlot team
 named the Bloomfield Rams. Baltimore signed him for the next season, 1956, and
 he was on his way to a Hall of Fame career.

            But even Unitas didn't have the season for the ages that Warner had this
 year while winning the NFL Most Valuable Player award and leading the Rams to
 the Super Bowl. Unlike Unitas, Warner wasn't even drafted out of college,
 though he had sent highlight tapes of his best games to every NFL team. Warner
 did wrangle an invitation to the Green Bay Packers training camp in '94. But he
 was promptly cut. For the next three seasons, Warner didn't get another NFL
 invitation, so he played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football
 League.
