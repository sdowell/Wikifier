               Hold, a 30-second clip
 produced for the Clinton campaign by Bob Squier of Squier, Knapp &
 Ochs.
            

            Republican commercials are
 laboring to make taxes and character the central issues of the presidential
 campaign. The Clinton War Room--a state of mind this year, not a place--strikes
 back with Hold , a tough, frontal (and potentially dangerous) response
 prepared by adman Bob Squier at the direction of the president's chief
 strategist, Dick Morris.

            The Clinton ad begins not
 with the issue of taxes but with character, accusing Dole of engaging in the
 old "attack" politics (proving once again that the best use of negatives can be
 accusing the other guy of going negative). The bold red chyrons used in the
 ad--scarlet letters that appear here and later in the spot--are a chromatic
 charge of wrongdoing leveled against Dole. Hold both responds to the tax
 attacks made by Dole and sows seeds of doubt about future Republican assaults.
 The timing is excellent: According to the polls, Clinton has been attacked so
 often that he is in need of a Teflon coating.

            
               Hold presents Dole
 in age-emphasizing black-and-white videotape, with a drawing of the Capitol in
 the background, indicating that the former senator hasn't left that unpopular
 venue. Color footage, complete with a shot of the Marine band in the
 background, lends Clinton presidential depth and authority. The ad argues that
 Clinton cut taxes, thereby confronting both the tax issue and the
 conventional wisdom about him and his party. (Voters believe that Clinton
 raised taxes and generally resist any argument that Democrats are better at
 reducing taxes.)

            The danger of Hold
 lies in its boldness. If taxes became the defining issue, the terrain would
 naturally favor Dole. But if Clinton seizes the tax issue, what does Dole have
 left?
