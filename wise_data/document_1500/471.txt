            Is it OK to stop saying: "Big week in the markets"? But it was. Spurred,
 oddly enough, by a Fed rate hike--it used to be programmatic that stock prices
 fell when the Fed raised rates--the Dow reached 11,000 for the first time in
 months and the Nasdaq set new record after new record. Price-to-earnings ratios
 are fairly meaningless statistics--since they don't take into account how much
 capital companies are using to get their earnings--but if we can use a
 meaningless stat, the market's current P/E ratio puts all those that came
 before it to shame. Or, alternatively, the market's current P/E ratio makes all
 those that came before it look sane. (Those two sentences sound so much alike,
 and yet mean such different things.) Of course, the fact that the United States
 and China reached a deal on a wide-ranging trade agreement is a nice symbolic
 statement of part of the reason why U.S. stocks are so much more valuable today
 than they were a decade ago. The world, at least in the economic sense, is just
 a much bigger and more profitable place. Which doesn't mean you need to eat,
 drink, and be merry tonight. But at the very least, Chat.

            1. "The United States and China reached a landmark trade
 agreement . As part of the deal, China agreed to import up to
 40 American films a year, up from 10 a year now. An unwritten side
 deal ensured that neither Message in a Bottle nor Random Hearts
 would be included in the list."

            2. "Gucci announced that it won a quiet bidding war for
 luxury retailer Yves Saint Laurent. Soon there will be only four major
 fashion companies in the world --Gucci, LVMH, Prada, and Armani--and
 they'll still be competing for the exact same tiny group of customers."

            3. "Standard & Poor's said Pakistan had effectively defaulted on
 its bonds when it asked current investors to swap their old bonds for
 new ones.
