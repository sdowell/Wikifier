            My dear, thank you.

            My primary news sources today have been the New York Times Op-Ed page
 and MTV News, venues in which William Bennett and Whitney Houston addressed the
 need for compassion and optimism in this old world of ours in ways that were
 disturbingly similar. I leave you to guess which in which venue. Bennett also
 happily commented on the decrease in noise, graffiti, and panhandling in New
 York City under the Giuliani administration, as I would like to say only
 someone who lives in D.C., as he does, could, except that many people who live
 here do also, although it does to a large degree depend on where you live. The
 tourists who come into my neighborhood make every bit as much, if not more,
 noise than the homeless who have gone out. I used to have a number of friends
 among the homeless crack-addicted mentally ill in my neighborhood eight or so
 years ago, and although this friendship was not financially a totally equal
 two-way street, I did borrow money from them on a few occasions when I was
 running late and didn't want to stop at a cash machine. It's true that they
 were smelly and that the sight of poverty and desperation are not pleasant, and
 they all told the same self-serving lies for my benefit, and could never
 remember no matter how many times they were told that white women don't think
 it's a compliment to be told they have big legs, and they were noisy, although
 they would pipe down if you cared to go out at three in the morning to ask,
 which the tourists sure won't. I occasionally still see some of these
 people--two have gotten clean, and two live on and deteriorate, but the other
 half-dozen faded from view, three because they died, and two of those in
 circumstances directly related to the more dangerous, harder-assed
 neighborhoods into which they were swept by Giuliani's quality-of-life
 campaign, one because he was set on fire.
