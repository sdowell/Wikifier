            Each of the majors goes its own way today for a lead. The Washington Post leads with the emerging consensus among
 many senators that the Clinton trial might begin just days after the new
 Congress convenes and could proceed very swiftly. The New York Times
 puts a similar story inside. The Wall Street Journal flags this story in its front-page news
 box, with its headline saying that the Senate's consensus "dashes Clinton's
 hopes" for making a deal and avoiding a trial. The Los Angeles
 Times goes with Sunday's news from the DOJ that violent crime in
 America has fallen to its lowest level in at least 24 years. According to the
 NYT lead about the retail economy, Americans knew just what to do about
 a presidential impeachment and combat against Iraq: go shopping. At many big
 chains, this month's sales will likely be, says the paper, between 4 and 5
 percent higher than last December. USA Today ,
 which fronts the shopping story, uses its lead to detail a little-noticed
 political trend shaping up for 1999: pay raises for state legislators. State
 representatives' salaries are going up, says the paper, in at least ten states.
 A citizens' panel approved California's 26 percent raise to the nation's
 lushest rate of almost $100,000, and in second place, New York's legislature
 came up with a 38 percent raise to $79,500. But not all state pols are in this
 stratosphere: Arizona's 60 percent raise took it to a ceiling of $24,000, in
 Connecticut, a 30 percent raise meant only getting to $21,800, and in Idaho, 19
 percent meant just to $14,760. (One problem: USAT doesn't say which if
 any legislatures are only part-time jobs.)

            According to the WP , senators went out of their way on Sunday chat
 show appearances to appear less partisan and less combative than their House
 counterparts had seemed when they had the impeachment ball in their court. The
 Post says Sen.
