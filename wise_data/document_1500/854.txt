            Everybody leads with that case-against-Iraq speech President Clinton gave at
 the Pentagon yesterday. Speaking to an auditorium full of military and civilian
 Defense employees, and from a platform he shared with his Secretary of Defense
 and his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Clinton justified possible airstrikes
 with an implicit reference to the failures of appeasement in the period just
 before World War II. "Force can never be the first answer," said Clinton. "But
 sometimes, it's the only answer."

            In its piece on the speech, USA Today mentions that the Secretary-General of the
 U.N., Kofi Annan, is going to Baghdad to try for a peaceful resolution. The
 Washington Post makes it clear that if Annan's
 mission fails to produce Iraqi compliance, an air bombardment is a "virtual
 certainty." The administration's old line was, says the paper, "weeks not
 months," but its new one is "days not weeks."

            Both the WP and the New York Times
 note that Clinton has defined down his military objective--now we are after,
 not totally ridding Iraq of mass destruction weapons, but seriously diminishing
 their threat. However, Clinton did not, notes the Times , explain at what
 point he would consider the Iraqi threat seriously diminished.

            The Times ' James Bennet obviously got to somebody present at the
 military briefing Clinton attended just before speaking. His report reveals
 that the briefing ran 45 minutes and centered on the details of a military
 strike. Clinton mostly listened and made no new decisions. But he did ask about
 the potential casualties in a strike, both among Iraqi civilians and American
 pilots. He also asked about Iraq's ability to use chemical and biological
 weapons in a confrontation.

            Both the WP and the NYT mention President Clinton's dismissal
 of Saddam's desire to exempt certain "presidential" sites from weapons
 inspection.
