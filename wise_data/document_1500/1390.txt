 or Bust
            

            A final reminder: Effective
 Monday, March 9, at around 5 p.m. PT, 
                  Slate
                becomes a
 members-only site. Click here to sign up for a charter subscription. Each $19.95
 one-year charter subscription comes with two free extra weeks, a free

                  Slate
                umbrella or Microsoft ® Encarta ® Virtual Globe, and a
 guarantee that the rate will never go up for as long as you renew. And of
 course (for a modest $1.95 surcharge) our gratitude at having you along.

            As of this writing, two
 weeks after we began accepting credit cards, about 10,000 subscribers have
 signed up. In a world where a formidable institution like the Wall Street Journal has 180,000-plus
 paying online subscribers more than a year after it started charging, and where
 Playboy's site is
 considered a success at 22,000 subscribers, we're pretty pleased that 10,000
 people signed up before they even had to. (Naturally, the meter on a

                  Slate
                subscription doesn't start running until March 9, even if
 you signed up early.) Our goal is to have 15,000 to 20,000 subscribers within
 the first few months.

            If you
 haven't done so already, please sign up now.
 (If you prefer the telephone, call [800] 706-3330. Operators are standing by.
 Or they'd better be.)

 decision to ask its readers to pay $19.95 a year (for a product valued by the
 independent Microsoft Internet Content Laboratory at "$5,922.95 a year and not
 a penny less") has produced a flood of comments, ranging from "Drop dead, you
 greedbags" to "My husband reads 
                  Slate
                over my shoulder sometimes,
 so here is $39.90--can I have two umbrellas?"

            
 Remarkably, two members of the president's Cabinet have sent favorable comments
 with their credit-card info.
