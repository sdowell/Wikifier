            Dear Judith,

            Nice e-mail. I'm glad to see you're ending this exchange without busting a
 cap in my ass.

            OK--Carmela Soprano is Hillary Clinton? I want to run this one by
 Chatterbox.

            You've got it exactly right--it's evident from the first episodes of the new
 season that the writers have lost interest in Carmela, which is a tragedy,
 because, as you put it so well (have you ever thought of taking up a career in
 writing?), Tony's sister Havarti, or whatever she's called, is an "epic
 drag."

            Your observations about Carmela, and your questions about Meadow and Anthony
 junior, her two children, bring us to one of the more interesting subtopics in
 mobology: What do the families know, and how do they live with what they
 know?

            The answer, especially to the second question, is mostly unknowable to
 outsiders. I have never spoken to a child of a mobster who said, straight-out,
 yeah, my father's a made man, and I'm not going to cover-up for him anymore.
 Even when the father's are dead, the children still lie. One of Paul
 Castellano's sons (a completely legitimate guy, as far as I could tell), told
 me that there is no such thing as organized crime, and that his father was set
 up by the government the same way Clinton was set up. Mob families (not
 Families, but actual nuclear families) are among the most dysfunctional on the
 planet--they lie, they wear masks on top of masks, and they live off dirty
 money. I remember sitting with Vicky Gotti one day last year, asking her what
 she thought her father really did for a living. Remember--this is years after
 her father was convicted of being the boss of the Gambino family. No one in
 America today believes that John Gotti was a simple plumbing-supply salesman.
 But all she could come up with was this: "There's more to my father than people
 know.
