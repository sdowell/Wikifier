 President Clinton opened his hourlong news conference Thursday with a defense
 of his budget proposals and a critique of Republican tax-cut plans. Newspapers
 duly reported his quarrels with the GOP over revenue projections and the cost
 of new Medicare benefits. Which side will prevail on these matters remains to
 be seen. But the underlying struggle to shape the terms of the debate remains
 invisible to the media. And Clinton is winning that struggle hands down.

 Whose money is it? President Reagan used to argue constantly that federal
 money belonged to taxpayers, not "bureaucrats." Later, House Speaker Newt
 Gingrich took up this theme. But now both men are gone, and nobody in the GOP
 seems capable of battling Clinton's counterspin. Clinton chooses words that
 oblige the media and the public to look at every financial question from the
 standpoint of the government rather than the taxpayer. The Republican tax cut
 plan will "cost" too much and cause "an enormous loss to the American people,"
 Clinton argued Thursday. This obscures the alternative point of view--that
 taxes themselves impose "costs" and "losses" on everyone who has to pay the
 Internal Revenue Service.

            
 Likewise, Clinton shrewdly portrays tax cuts as a kind of "spending." At his
 news conference, he questioned how Republicans could "finance" their tax cuts.
 Words such as these dissolve the moral difference between giving money "back"
 to the people it came from, as Reagan and Gingrich used to put it, and passing
 it on to others instead. Once the question is framed as how to "finance" tax
 cuts--implying that the government owns the money and gets to decide who should
 receive it--conservatives can't win.

 Who can spend it more wisely? Conservatives used to frame this question as
 a choice between government "spending" and private "investment." "Investment"
 meant the money was working and growing.
