            The Supreme Court's refusal to fast-track the legal battle between President
 Clinton and Kenneth Starr leads all the papers. The life sentence without the
 possibility of parole handed to Oklahoma bombing figure Terry Nichols draws
 front-page coverage at the New York Times ,
 Washington Post and Los Angeles
 Times , but USA Today puts it on page 3. Nichols was expected to be put
 away for keeps unless he spoke to the court in a particularly informative or
 remorseful way, but he made no statement. The WP and NYT say
 Nichols, called an "enemy of the Constitution" by the judge, displayed no
 emotion. But the LAT says that upon entering the courtroom, he broke into
 tears. As in previous key Oklahoma bombing proceedings, no statements rivaled
 in power those of survivors and victims' relatives. The NYT reports that one woman who saw many dead babies
 at the bombing site testified that whenever "I see these mothers with empty
 arms, I wonder, was that your baby I kissed on his way to heaven?"

            The Court's decision to return the Lewinsky case issues of attorney-client
 and protective privilege back to the regular appeals court process is generally
 taken as a rebuff for Starr's contention that these matters pose a
 constitutional crisis of the first magnitude. There is more divergence about
 what this does to the course of the case. The LAT says that this might
 keep Starr from questioning White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey and Secret Service
 officers until "well into next year." But USAT says that the Supreme
 Court might well end up hearing the case "by month's end."

            The LAT "Column One" fascinates today with a story of
 breakthrough genetic research being done in Iceland. It seems that Iceland
 provides the best database in the world for trying to isolate genes responsible
 for such scourges as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, adult-onset diabetes and
 stroke.
