            One of the more remarked-upon trends in modern (actually, postmodern ,
 I guess) advertising is the reliance upon anti-ads, those commercials that
 acknowledge the basic insincerity of the adman's project and which presumably
 please viewers by nudge-nudge, wink-winking them in a way that recognizes how
 phenomenally aware we are of advertising's attempts to ensnare us. Sprite's
 "Thirst Is Everything" campaign, with its faux pop songs touting the drink's
 magical powers, is the most obvious example, and some days it feels as if we're
 all living in the world The Monkees made.

            The past few months, though, have given us an entirely new--and relatively
 unremarked-upon--advertising trend, which might be called the "consumers are
 dumb as a post" phenomenon. The campaign for AT&T's "Single One Rate" plan
 thus features Paul Reiser going around talking to people about how now every
 long-distance call they make with AT&T will cost just 7 cents a minute,
 while those he talks to react with a mix of befuddlement and incredulity,
 peppering him with questions that show that they just don't get what
 7-cents-a-minute really means.

            Similarly, Burger King's new radio campaign for its Cini-Minis centers on an
 announcer trying to explain that Cini-Minis cost just 99 cents to a group of
 people who ask questions like, "If I had 17 cents, could I get a Cini-Mini?"
 And Merrill Lynch's utterly bizarre television ads for its new pricing
 structure/Internet strategy all feature Merrill customers who just can't quite
 understand what this whole newfangled approach is going to mean, like the guy
 who tells his broker how much he'll miss her, even as she assures him that
 she'll still be around.

            The Merrill campaign is by far the strangest exemplar of the trend, since
 what the ads--which include one in which confused customers quiz a panel of
 Merrill execs at a kind of town meeting--actually point out is both how dubious
 the whole brokerage business was to begin with and how potentially
 damaging the new pricing structure (which includes much lower commissions) will
 be to Merrill's bottom line.
