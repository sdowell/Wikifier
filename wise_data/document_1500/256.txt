            Chatterbox loves to go to the movies. Mostly this is because he loves
 movies, but partly it's because moviegoers enjoy one of the last great consumer
 bargains in America. This is not widely recognized. Especially in New York City
 (where prices for movie tickets, and most other things, are higher than they
 are elsewhere in the United States), politicians are constantly grandstanding
 about the high price of movie tickets. In March, New York City Council Speaker
 Peter Vallone issued a press
 release urging the Justice Department to intervene because Loew's Cineplex
 had just raised ticket prices in Manhattan to $9.50. Vallone kicked up a
 similar fuss two years ago when Sony-Loew's New York Lincoln Square Multiplex
 raised prices to $9. A decade earlier, then-Mayor Ed Koch actually urged a
 boycott when movie-ticket prices rose from $6 to $7. (Click here to
 read CNN's coverage of the earlier controversies.) The boycott fizzled because
 ... well, because, $7 wasn't all that much to spend on an evening's
 entertainment in Fun City.

            Chatterbox lives in Washington, where a Saturday night visit to what is
 widely recognized as the area's spiffiest movie theater, an Art Deco palace
 called the Uptown, costs $7.75 ($9 if you purchase an advance ticket by phone).
 That's still "high" by national standards; according to the Motion Picture
 Association of America, the average movie-ticket price last year was a mere
 $4.69. Is that higher than it used to be?

            Take a look at this chart, which Chatterbox found on a Web page about inflation that
 was forwarded to him and several other journalists by Jonathan Rauch,
 the economics columnist for National Journal . Observe that in constant dollars,
 movie-ticket prices more than doubled between 1935 (when they cost a quarter;
 that's $2.93 in 1999 dollars) and 1970 (when they cost $1.55; $6.68 in 1999
 dollars).
