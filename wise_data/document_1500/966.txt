            The Los
 Angeles Times , New York
 Times , and Washington Post lead with assessments of Thursday's cruise
 missile attacks. Each paper reports that the Clinton administration claimed
 moderate success and warned of possible strikes against terrorists in the near
 future. The papers all report that bin Laden survived the attack and that at
 least 20 ( NYT ) or 21 ( WP , LAT ) people were killed by
 missiles fired into Afghanistan. The WP pinpoints the number of
 Tomahawks launched at 79, the LAT and NYT say 75. Splitting
 hairs? Not according to the WP 's lead which gives a cost estimate of $1
 million per missile.

            The NYT and LAT report that President Clinton added bin Laden
 to the Treasury Department's list of official terrorists. This allows the feds
 to seize any U.S. assets he may possess and hopefully weakens his attempts at
 financing terrorist activities. Both papers question why bin Laden had not been
 placed on the list earlier.

            A WP above-the-fold news analysis says that the U.S. attack has
 shifted the fight against terrorism from a legal to a military one--national
 security has superceded due process. The results of this change will be
 psychological: bold, unilateral action bolsters moral at home, inspires
 confidence in allies, and intimidates enemies.

            From the "If at first you don't succeed" department: Clinton is considering
 another public address concerning his relationship with "that woman." The
 LAT reports that White House insiders want the President to publicly
 discuss the issue, this time clearly expressing "contrition" for his
 inappropriate activities with then-intern Lewinsky. The particular medium for
 such remarks has not been agreed upon.

            Clinton's grand jury testimony leaks its way into the WP off-lead.
 According to sources, the President testified that he gave Lewinsky several
 gifts on Dec.
