            By the time most of you read this, the Producer Price Index for November
 will have been released, and if this month's other economic statistics are any
 indication, the PPI will show only very mild inflationary pressure back up the
 producer pipeline. With the exception of energy prices, in fact, inflation
 remains about as quiescent as it can be, despite the fact that the economy
 continues to grow at a better-than-4 percent clip and that the unemployment
 rate has reached levels no one thought were possible anymore. If you take
 energy and food prices out of the Consumer Price Index--giving you the
 so-called core rate--prices in 1999 will have risen around 1.75 percent, which
 is the lowest annual inflation rate we've had during this entire business
 cycle. (Is "cycle" even the right word anymore?)

            No one, of course, really knows why this is happening. But there is one
 remarkable statistic (which itself is difficult to explain): Since the middle
 of last year, the falling unemployment rate has become decoupled from wage
 increases. In other words, even though it's getting harder and harder to find
 workers, the tight labor markets are not yet translating into wage increases in
 excess of productivity. This may be evidence of the new winner-take-all
 society, or of continued anxiety among workers, or it may be that the wage
 gains due to productivity are enough to keep workers happy. Or perhaps it's
 just evidence that Alan Greenspan really is God. In any case, on to the
 Chat.
