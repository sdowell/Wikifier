            John F. Kennedy Jr., who
 styles himself "editor in chief and founder" of George magazine, has
 offered a considerable challenge to magazine editors everywhere by posing nude
 in the September issue of his publication. For too long, journalists have been
 content to expose other people. Is it not time for them to start exposing
 themselves? The thought of naked magazine editors--with the exception of JFK
 Jr., of course--is not one many readers will find appealing. Whatever reason
 one might have for subscribing to George , the editor in chief's body is
 unlikely to be a major selling point for, say, Time or Newsweek .
 But we in the magazine industry believe deeply--if we believe anything at
 all--that a trend is a trend and cannot be resisted. Therefore, naked editors
 it is.

            Here at Slate, though, we
 eschew grandiose titles like "editor in chief," let alone "founder." At the
 special staff meeting called to discuss the issue of who should bare all for
 the good of the magazine, there was a groundswell of support for calling upon
 the CEO of Microsoft--but no one volunteered to make the call. In the end, the
 editor decided to delegate the challenge of self-exposure to the New York
 editor, who delegated it to an associate editor, who delegated it to an
 assistant editor, who delegated it to the youngest member of our staff, Aidan
 Weed, whose title is Special Issue of the Publisher.

            Although Weed does not
 technically bare all, he does--unlike his rival in George --refrain from
 making clever use of light and shadow to hide the aspects of the story that
 interest his readers the most. Like Kennedy, however, Weed uses the occasion to
 vent some controversial opinions about his relatives. His mother and father, he
 reveals, are "just terrible parents. They're driving me crazy with their 'eat
 this .
