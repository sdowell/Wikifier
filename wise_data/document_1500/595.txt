            The promise of the Internet, from a business perspective, is the promise of
 a frictionless economy, in which buyers and sellers are able to meet without
 mediation. And since perhaps the most disliked mediators out there are car
 dealers, they would seem to be natural and inevitable casualties of consumers'
 migration to the Internet. Very few people like bargaining with car dealers.
 Auto companies don't like their now-almost-required reliance on rebates to move
 cars. And the whole phenomenon of the huge dealership, with acres of cars, each
 depreciating by the minute, seems like an archaic way of handling distribution
 (and, since someone has to make all those cars, production).

            At the same time, the smartest auto manufacturers, like Ford and Toyota, are
 already working hard at integrating the Internet into their operations and
 developing build-to-order systems. Eventually, you should be able to
 communicate directly with Ford, pick out the car you want with the options you
 want, and have it delivered to your door, just like a Dell PC. Ford won't have
 to make cars it's not going to be able to sell, and you won't have to haggle
 with some dealer. (This was what I was imagining at the end of the last
 Moneybox, when I wrote about GM truly becoming an Internet company.)

            The only problem with this picture of the future is that it's currently
 against the law. Just about every state in the United States, in fact, has
 strong franchise laws that limit the size and scope of dealerships, effectively
 regulate the allocation of vehicles to dealers, bar large-volume discounts, and
 prevent dealers from selling across state lines. Needless to say, actually
 buying a car on the Internet is therefore impossible, which is why all the
 car-buying services on the Net are actually local filtering devices, allowing
 you to comparison-shop.
