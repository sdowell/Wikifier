            The New York Times leads with how business lobbyists view the
 just-concluded session of Congress. Very enthusiastically, says the paper, in a
 story running under a brutal headline: "CONGRESS LEAVES BUSINESS LOBBIES ALMOST
 ALL SMILES." The Washington Post goes with a sum-up of the FBI
 investigation into EgyptAir 990--an effort that by now involves hundreds of
 agents in Washington, Cairo, and elsewhere. The Los Angeles Times
 leads with a mushrooming source of medical inflation--the rising cost of
 prescription medications advertised on television--which are typically at least
 twice as expensive as older, over-the-counter, unadvertised counterparts. The
 paper explains that since the FDA's 1997 decision to permit prescription drug

 general inflation rate. USA Today goes with a nonpartisan group's
 recently compiled figures indicating that Bill Bradley has a fund-raising lead
 over Al Gore in California, New York, Illinois, and New Jersey, and is also
 leading the money race in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two earliest primary
 states.

 in the minimum wage, no regulation of health-care plans, no campaign finance
 reform, and no ban on agribusiness mergers. The paper says business's
 "knockout"legislative feat was a triumph over the trial lawyers: passage of a
 law limiting Y2K lawsuits.

            According to the Post lead, the FBI's willingness to let the NTSB
 (the government's accident investigation body) remain for the time being in
 charge of the EgyptAir investigation, rather than officially ratcheting it up
 into an up-front criminal probe, has a payoff: It placates the Egyptian
 authorities, who therefore have been more cooperative in sharing flight and
 personnel records with the Bureau, which outside the U.
