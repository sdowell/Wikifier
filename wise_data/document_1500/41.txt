            Hi Jim:

            As a fellow remote worker, I empathize with your rage against the machine,
 although I am still not willing to concede that "workplace rage" is a phenom
 worth adding to the lexicon.

            I haven't seen Office Space , but a few years ago at the Burning Man festival,
 that annual West Coast orgy of all things arty and survivalist held in Nevada's
 Black Rock Desert, I saw computer programmers gleefully blowing up old hard
 drives and monitors just for fun. How's that for evidence of dependence on
 technology breeding antipathy toward it, not to mention the self-evident
 visceral pleasure of detonating expensive equipment that so quickly becomes
 obsolete? Boom.

            Today's media offer a nice corollary to your rage against the machine, in
 the form of Thomas Friedman's "Foreign Affairs" column "The Y2K Social Disease"
 in the New York Times . What's more annoying than technology that doesn't
 work when you need it to? How about other's people's technology invading your
 space? And the chilling implications of none of us ever really being logged
 off? Technology is making the boundaries between work and play evaporate,
 Friedman worries, until there will be no downtime. Work, as the saying goes, is
 expanding to fill all available time, now with the help of these handy
 interruption devices--pager, cell phone, fax, handheld.

            Friedman declares that the real Y2K problem is overconnectedness. He
 fantasizes about restaurants of the future with cell phone and no cell phone
 sections. (Here in the Bay Area, I've been to more than one eating
 establishment with signs explicitly forbidding the use of cell phones, but have
 yet to see the appearance of phoning sections.)

            But guess what? This phenomenon of overconnectedness turns out to be just
 another excuse to add one more new rage to our list, which is growing seemingly
 by the hour, road rage, air rage, workplace rage, now "Y2K rage.
