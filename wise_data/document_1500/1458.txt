 Intestine Wrap-Up
            

            Although many of you submitted enema jokes, I ran
 none--an aesthetic not a political decision, if such a distinction is possible.
 Some laugh at colonic humor, some don't. I have no doubt that several entries
 were particularly fine examples of rectal comedy. These I have passed along to
 my London counterpart, Sophie Rhys-Cohen, who plans to run them in "Naughty
 Scamp," the English edition of News Quiz, along with many comical pictures of
 men in women's clothing and a terrific photograph of Queen Elizabeth's left
 breast. (At least they said it was hers when Sophie R-C handed over Â£100,000 of
 Bill Gates' money.)

            Incidentally, Naughty
 Scamp is still encouraging participants to suggest better things to do with
 fresh fruits and vegetables than eat them.
