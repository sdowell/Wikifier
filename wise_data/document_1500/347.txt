            Among the many factors that sent the stock market
 tumbling last week was Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's speech Thursday night to a
 conference sponsored by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. (I'm
 assuming that's the United States' Comptroller of the Currency, though I'm not
 really sure what the comptroller of the currency, as opposed to a comptroller
 of a company, does.)

            Greenspan's speech, which dealt with the "fundamental
 sources of risk" and the limitations of the traditional risk-management models
 financial institutions use, did not spook an already nervous stock market
 because anyone actually read or listened to the speech. It spooked the market
 because Greenspan mentioned the reality of market panics, and because he linked
 "Dutch tulip bulbs" with "Russian equities." God only knows what would have
 happened had he mentioned "tulip bulbs" and "Internet stocks" in the same
 phrase.

            Greenspan didn't make that connection, but a lot of
 outside observers did, leading to the inevitable conclusion that, in his
 typically oblique way, the Fed chairman was trying to talk down stock prices in
 general and Internet stock prices--which, though not quite as gaudy as they
 were back in April, are still pretty hefty--in particular.

            This is the wrong conclusion. Although Greenspan did
 speak to the idea that investors are starting to see stocks as not much more
 risky than bonds (an idea associated with the authors of Dow 36,000 --see 
                  Slate
               's "Crapshoot" for a critique of this idea), the real focus of his
 speech was something much broader, namely the way financial panics tend to
 eradicate the delicate distinctions between different classes of assets,
 distinctions that any market system needs in order to invest for the
 future.

            The two most striking things about financial panics, at
 least in the modern economic world, are that they happen more often than one
 would expect in a normal (bell-curve-shaped) distribution of events, and that
 when they happen, they tend to spread rather than remain localized.
