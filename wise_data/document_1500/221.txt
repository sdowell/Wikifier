               Judging Amy , a CBS drama premiering tonight at 10 p.m., imitates
 NBC's Providence , which returns for another season on Friday at 8 p.m.,
 and Providence incarnates a new kind of show second in hotness only to
 those aimed at teen-agers: the series meant to keep high-spending grown-up
 women from abandoning network television. (Now that Geraldine Laybourne has
 started Oxygen, a cable channel for women, the networks fear that the hitherto
 male world of cable could start stealing their loyal female viewers.)  

            Both shows feature leggy professional babes with big, fabulous tresses (Amy
 Brenneman of NYPD Blue as Amy in Judging Amy , Melina Kanakaredes
 as Syd Hansen in Providence ) who have thrown over high-powered careers
 (corporate law for Amy, plastic surgery for Syd) in fast-paced cities (New
 York, Los Angeles) for noble, self-sacrificing careers (family court judge,
 family doctor) in depressed Northeastern cities (Hartford, Providence), where
 they both move in with their families. The divorcing Amy is marginally more
 believable as a woman whose life has taken a scary new turn than the
 unflappable single Syd ever was--Amy gets flustered; she doesn't know what to
 wear; her clothes don't seem designed to show off an improbably sculpted body,
 as Syd's do; she has no pat reasons for having left her husband; her mom,
 played by Tyne Daly, is pitch-perfect as the smart, confident older woman who
 quashes her daughter (she's a more compelling character than Syd's father, a
 wan veterinarian who can do no wrong); and Amy's own daughter--well, Amy's
 daughter is unbearable, a stereotypical know-it-all TV tyke. Overall, though,
 both shows are riffs on the same Mary Tyler Moore theme, which after 30
 years has become the key slogan of TV feminism: They're going to make it after
 all.

             The difference between Mary Richards and these two, of course, is that she
 was striking out on her own, and they, having done so, are coming home.
