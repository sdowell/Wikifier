            After years of denial, the FBI has admitted to using pyrotechnic (or
 "incendiary") tear gas in the 1993 Federal assault on the Branch Davidian
 compound in Waco, Texas. What is pyrotechnic tear gas and why is it
 controversial?

            Tear gas is a basic tool of law enforcement. It causes extreme, disabling,
 but usually temporary discomfort, and therefore is considered a humane
 alternative to using guns. There are three common ways to disperse tear gas.
 Aerosol hoses work like an insecticide spray. They cause the least
 amount of physical damage, but can only be used up close. Powder
 grenades can be thrown from a distance and send up a mist of powder.
 Pyrotechnic devices also launch tear gas from afar, in combination with
 a heat source. The result is an explosion, releasing a cloud of tear gas
 particles mixed with smoke. Pyrotechnic tear gas has tactical advantages.
 First, the smoke cloud obscures the movement of agents as they approach a
 building or crowd. Second, because the metal casing becomes quite hot, it is
 difficult for the device to be thrown back at police (a common problem with
 powder grenades). The disadvantage is that it can start a fire. The FBI
 insists, however, that the timing and location make it impossible to blame
 pyrotechnic tear gas for the fire that killed 76 people at Waco.

            A former CIA officer told the Dallas Morning News that members of the
 Army's Delta Force were present at the Waco standoff. Military documents
 confirmed that three commandos observed the siege on the Branch Davidian
 compound. The Pentagon stated that it could not discuss any aspect of the Delta
 Force--including whether it exists. What is the Delta Force?

            The Delta Force is a counterterrorism group established in 1977 by the
 Carter administration following some particularly bloody attacks on Americans
 abroad.
