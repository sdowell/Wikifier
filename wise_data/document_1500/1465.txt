 Wrap-Up
            

            The worst part about the sea, as Ramanathan and the
 Scripps Institution of Oceanography must both lament when it comes time for
 their annual talent show, is that nothing amusing ever takes place beneath it.
 Which you certainly couldn't say about Errol Flynn. Which is why NoÃ«l Coward
 set so few of his plays underwater. James Bond, on the other hand, is always
 poking about in some villain's undersea lair, and his attempts at repartee are
 just parody bait. When the diving suits go on, the witty banter stops.
 Something to do with all those air hoses, like trying to be witty at the
 dentist. It is impossible to name a single amusing movie that takes place
 beneath the waves.
