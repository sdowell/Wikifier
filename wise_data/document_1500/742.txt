            Dave--

            Oddly, in midtown, it's a balmy 72 degrees. You really ought to come up here
 for a visit; it's lovely.

            OK, so it's actually freezing cold here--colder than the mayor's heart, as
 New Yorkers like to say. Or as I like to imagine they like to say.

            Since there seems to be no earth-shattering news in today's papers, let's go
 right to my favorite story: the 78-year-old doorman, retiring from the Plaza
 Hotel. What I like about this story is that it's a perfect tabloid story--a
 heart-tugging human-interest piece, with lots of celebrity names--and, since
 both tabloids were clearly tipped off to it, it provides an ideal opportunity
 to compare and contrast the New York Post and the Daily

               News . As it happens, their coverage confirms a long-held belief of mine:
 You don't mess with Gersh Kuntzman. Kuntzman is, as best I can tell,
 responsible for something like half of the text that appears in the Post
 each day. You can find his byline all through a typical day's paper, usually
 appended to a few news items and at least one human-interest story, written
 with all the tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold panache you expect from the
 tabloids, but so rarely get. I like to imagine him as the sort of newspaper
 reporter you'd see in movies from the 1940s, pounding the street from dawn to
 dusk, picking up tips from shoeshine boys and calling his boss "Chief."

            For an object lesson in the magic of Gersh Kuntzman, compare the
 Plaza-doorman stories in the News and the Post . Both papers do a
 fine job of hitting the guy's career highlights (the Beatles, Jackie Gleason,
 Lana Turner). But the News glosses over the reason for his retirement
 ("Szorentini decided that yesterday would be his last day ..."). Gersh,
 however, gets the scoop: "'I wouldn't be leaving this job if it weren't for my
 heart.
