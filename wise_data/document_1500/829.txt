            The Washington Post leads with the threatened resignation of
 Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy. The New York Times leads with possible complications in
 the economic bailout plan for South Korea. USA Today
 leads with the nationwide push for tougher drunk driving laws. The Los Angeles
 Times leads with the fatal shooting of a local police officer. L.A.
 police have shot and killed a suspect in the case.

            The WP lead says Israeli Foreign Minister Levy may quit over a budget
 dispute with Benjamin Netanyahu. The Foreign Minister's beef: Netanyahu is
 keeping his fragile coalition together by doling out funds to conservative
 religious groups, rather than fixing the economy. The WP buries this
 crucial detail after the jump. The NYT front-page story announces it up
 top, in the second paragraph, and adds an item the WP misses: Levy has
 threatened to quit several times before, without doing so. If Levy does quit,
 both papers agree, the Netanyahu government could fall. The Wall Street Journal puts the story in its World-Wide
 newsbox.

            The NYT lead fingers small banks as possible spoilers in the South
 Korea financial bailout. Most large international banks, following the IMF
 plan, have extended their loans to South Korea, letting it fix its economy
 before repaying debts. But several small foreign banks, with less to gain from
 a strong South Korea, will not extend loans, possibly jeopardizing the entire
 bailout. According to the NYT , the South Korean government issued a
 televised request to citizens for donations of gold jewelry. A WP
 front-page story on the crisis says South Korean accountants are seeking
 western-style training. The IMF plan will require stricter and more open
 accounting measures from the country, which traditionally cooks its books and
 keeps its ledgers hidden.

            The USAT lead covers the coming fight for lower blood-alcohol limits
 in drunk driving cases.
