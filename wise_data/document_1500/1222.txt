               "We've been made the butt of a joke in New York--on television, in the
 newspapers. We take it not as funny but as something very serious." Who said
 this about what?

               Fill in the blank. Bernard Salick's entrepreneurial ideas may play in
 California, but they'll never make it in New York, says Warren Enker: "Not too
 many people want ____________ at 4 a.m., so it's not that great a
 gimmick."

 Salick to tell them they're pretty ... and smart, too."--Jennifer
 Miller

            That several jokes about
 California cuisine mention cilantro is unexceptional (click ). That many jokes
 about California's erotic life mention enemas is disconcerting. Are we 5 years
 old? Are we English? Are we meat and potatoes men who never get near fresh
 fruits or vegetables? No, we're not. We're constantly frolicking about in all
 that damn cilantro. We Californians apparently do little else. We eat eccentric
 meals and enjoy sex and drugs with our film business colleagues, all of whom
 look fabulous courtesy of the surgeon's art. And if technically cilantro is
 neither fruit nor vegetable, that's the least of my classification problems.
