            Saul Bellow, 84, last month fathered a child born to his fifth wife, age 41.
 As a result of this news, which trickled out last week, Bellow risks being remembered not as the
 brilliant Nobel-laureate author of Herzog and The Adventures of Augie March , but as a Weekly World News
 curiosity. Eighty-four is older than 77, the previous
 famous-guy-becomes-dad-at-advanced-age record set by Tony
 Randall. (Most, though obviously nowhere near all, men over 70 are
 infertile.) It's so old, in fact, that Chatterbox wondered whether Bellow was
 the world's oldest dad, period. The new Guinness World Records 2000: Millennium Edition ,
 alas, doesn't say, though it does serve up as the "Oldest Mother" Arceli Keh, 63 when she gave birth (with a donated egg) in Los
 Angeles in 1996. (Incidentally, Chatterbox must second Luc Sante's opinion, expressed in the Jan. 16 New York Times
 Book Review , that the new Guinness is so glossied-up and
 dumbed-down--these days, it's mainly an appendage to a Guinness World Records:
 Primetime TV show--that it can no longer serve its hallowed function as
 settler of ale-fueled pub arguments. Two whole pages are devoted to
 world-record stats about supermodels; two more about "high fashion"; and two
 more about "street fashion." Has anyone ever argued in a pub about who the
 highest-paid supermodel is? Best arse maybe, but
 best-remunerated ? The latter, if you must know, is Claudia Schiffer.)

            The hunt for the world's oldest dad led Chatterbox to a bookmark-worthy Web
 site called "World
 Sexual Records," maintained by someone who identifies himself as J. Means
 and who appears to be affiliated with the University of Texas. (Means didn't answer Chatterbox's
 e-mail seeking more information about his bona fides, but the UT directory
 lists a senior in the engineering school named Jon Means with the same e-mail
 address.
