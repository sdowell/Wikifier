            Culturebox's first thought on reading Diana: In Search of Herself , Sally Bedell Smith's
 deliriously mean-spirited (though boringly written) catalog of all the ways the
 late fairy-tale princess turns out to have been troubled, trite, and
 exasperating, is that the British public didn't get its money's worth from the
 girl. During her marriage, according to the New York Times , Diana
 cost her subjects $3,287 a day ($1.2 million a year). Much of that paid for
 clothing, cosmetics, hair styling, physical and speech training, health care,
 beauty treatments, fancy vacations, and a private staff--all legitimate
 expenses for a state official whose job it is to be a professional celebrity.
 (Why the British would pay their royals to do such a job is another
 question.)

            If you go by Smith's account, the rest must have gone to: 1) a surprisingly
 large number of cell-phone calls--up to 20 a day per person--to a surprisingly
 large number of lovers; 2) alternative therapists--astrologists (three),
 spiritualists (including a clairvoyant who put her in touch with her
 grandmother), a tarot card reader, an energy healer, a hypnotherapist, an
 "anger-release" therapist, colonic irrigationists, osteopaths, chiropractors,
 reflexologists, aromatherapists, shiatsu and tai chi chuan experts,
 acupuncturists, and a "mind-body" therapist, the last a former tax accountant
 who gave her massages and diet advice; 3) more conventional forms of treatment
 for sleeplessness, eating disorders, paranoia, and self-mutilation, including
 an episode in which she slashed her arms and smeared the blood all over the
 walls of an airplane; 4) lunch at fancy restaurants to which she secretly
 invited tabloid reporters so she could drop by their tables and leak whatever
 she wanted to appear in their publications the next day.

            When you think about it, Item 4 probably is in the job description
 for an official celebrity, which brings us to Culturebox's second reaction to
 this book: that the British got everything they paid for and more.
