               Despite the incitement
 of former Operation Rescue head Randall Terry to fight "this monstrous evil,"
 Barnes & Noble continues to do something. What?
            

            "Crush the small,
 independent, mom-and-pop child pornographers with lower prices, endless
 unlimited browsing, and exotic coffees."-- Chris Kelly
            

            "Put Terry's memoirs in
 the humor section."-- Patty Marx
            

            "Heavily promote the
 collected Edmund Wilson-Paula Barbieri letters."-- Meg Wolitzer
            

            "Continue to give a
 20-percent discount on hardback books to unborn children."-- Beth
 Sherman
            

            "Hold nude poetry readings
 by Germaine Greer, Betty Friedan, and Bill Baird (the abortion-rights advocate,
 not the famed puppeteer--who, by the way, has currently found work moving
 Annette Funicello's mouth)."-- Larry Amaros
            

            "Barnes & Noble
 continues to provide money to fund 1 st -trimester abortions for women
 accidentally impregnated while waiting in a really long line to pay for their
 books."-- Jon Hotchkiss
            

            "Sell Martha Stewart's
 Do-It-Yourself Guide to Festive Abortions at Home , along with its
 companion video."-- Nancy Franklin
            

            "Barnes & Noble
 continues to permit browsing, instead of forcing its tightwad,
 cappuccino-swilling, pick-up-minded clientele to BUY the books they have pawed
 through."-- M.G. Lord
            

            "Sell unauthorized
 Resident Evil 2 'Walk-Throughs.
