            The biggest news here in New York City last week was the sudden crackdown on
 double-parking. Traffic cops descended on Upper West Side neighborhoods and
 midtown business streets and issued a slew of tickets. Because residents are
 accustomed to double-parking on days when street-cleaning takes place--you
 double-park from 8 to 11 a.m., blocking in all the people who are parked
 legally--the crackdown was assailed as the effective criminalization of an
 accepted social custom. (In some sense, it probably was, and in Moneybox
 tomorrow, I'll have something on whether this matters.) But the more
 interesting aspect of Rudy Giuliani's latest attempt to bring order to our fair
 city was the way it showcased how little parking there is in New York.

            Now, as someone who drives fairly often into the city, I'm pleased by the
 crackdown, since double-parkers have the magical ability to turn three-lane
 avenues as wide as an Interstate into slow-moving country roads. (New York
 drivers will happily double-park, even while they're in their cars, rather than
 park a car too close to a fire hydrant, even though doing the latter will let
 traffic move smoothly. I'm hoping the recent crackdown will change this habit.)
 And it's certainly true that most double-parkers are just people trying to
 avoid paying for a parking garage, or deliverymen trying to avoid having to
 walk around the corner. So no pity for them. (Except when they're me or my
 friends, of course.) But people want to avoid paying for a spot in a parking
 garage because $8 seems a bit much for a half-hour. And, in any case, parking
 garages are usually full. These two phenomena are not, needless to say,
 unrelated.

            In fact, there are way too few parking garages in New York relative to the
 traffic, because the city, since the end of World War II, has limited the
 number of garages that can be built.
