            Everybody leads with the expected near-simultaneous release today to the
 Congress and the American people of the Starr report. You can't tell from the
 USA
 Today and Los Angeles Times headlines what the report says Clinton
 did. And indeed, the LAT lead never says. For that you have to turn to
 the Washington Post and New York Times
 headlines, which make it plain: lied (both papers), obstructed justice (the
 Post ) and abused power (the NYT ).

            The LAT lead emphasizes the struggle yesterday between get-it-out-now
 House Republicans and pro-delay Democrats over the timing of the report's
 release, a battle, say the papers, the Republicans have won. The LAT
 cites one argument Democrats wielded, but to no avail: when the House Ethics
 committee reprimanded Newt Gingrich last year, he was given an advance copy of
 the report. Only the WP notices that in describing the Starr report as
 one-sided, White House lawyer David Kendall was analyzing a report he hadn't
 read.

            
               USAT also tells of the pre-release battle and repeats its account of
 the report's charges from yesterday's edition: that Clinton obstructed justice
 in trying to find Monica Lewinsky a job and lied twice under oath about his
 relationship with her. These charges are expounded at much greater length in
 the NYT and WP . Oddly, USAT buries until the
 third-from-the-bottom paragraph the news that a source says Starr concludes
 Clinton committed eleven offenses that could warrant impeachment, a detail the
 WP rightly puts in its lead's first sentence.

            
               USAT says the report includes "graphic details about sexual
 encounters" between Clinton and Lewinsky but leaves it at that. The LAT
 goes a little farther with such titillating non-titillation, quoting a source
 telling the reporter, "I don't know how a newspaper like yours will be able to
 handle some of this material.
