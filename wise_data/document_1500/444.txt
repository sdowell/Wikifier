            In light of Secretary of State Albright's imminent trip to the middle east,
 the New York Times ,
 Los
 Angeles Times and Washington Post emphasize the deteriorating situation
 there. But USA Today stays with Princess Di.

            The NYT states that when Albright shows up on Tuesday, she will "read
 the riot act" to Yassir Arafat about cracking down on terrorism. Her goal will
 be to get Arafat to come out decisively and publicly for peace with Israel,
 telling him that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and "no more
 kisses" of its leaders.

            The Times emphasizes the larger geopolitical context. Given that the
 troubles on the West Bank have not only frosted relations between Arafat and
 Israel, but also those between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Saudi
 Arabia, the paper states that the U.S. is now facing the prospect that the
 moderate Arab coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain Iraq and
 Iran is falling apart.

            The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about
 whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon,
 dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was
 ambushed, with twelve deaths the result. Perhaps the most striking indicator of
 a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that
 cabinet member Ariel Sharon, who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel
 entrenched in Lebanon in the first place, is among those urging a
 reconsideration of the deployment.

            Several papers have word that H and R Block has finally wriggled out of its
 controlling stake of Compuserve, but it's the Post with the news that
 AOL is set to take it over.

            The Wall Street Journal "Outlook" observes, "In the U.S. job
 market, the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers," and
 states that "the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of
 corporate downsizing," which left behind survivors who took stock of career
 options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land
 better offers, which in turn led to counter-offers and higher salaries.
