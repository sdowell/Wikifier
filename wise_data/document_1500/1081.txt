            The Los
 Angeles Times and the Washington Post continue milking impeachment for leads. The
 LAT sounds the "temporary unity" theme for the Senate, while the WP
 exhaustively reviews the legal and political minutiae surrounding the upcoming
 Senate trial. The New York Times relegates impeachment to the off-lead and
 instead turns to tobacco, the old standby, to explain the creative ways states
 are spending the windfall from their victorious anti-tobacco lawsuit.

            The LAT emphasizes that the Senate's apparent unity of Friday could
 easily crumble when it comes time for the decision on whether to call
 witnesses. The paper quotes Senator Barbara Boxer as putting the odds of a
 continuing trial at 60:40, but she warns, "If [the Republicans] vote to
 continue, then they're going down a very treacherous path." Already, says the
 LA Times , fault lines are surfacing among Senate Republicans: Younger
 Republicans lean toward opting for witnesses, while older conservatives favor a
 quick cessation. The WP forecasts that the Senate trial will either be a
 "tedious rehashing of the existing evidence" or "a full O.J. Simpson-style
 spectacle." The Post delves into the legal what-ifs of the trial,
 including such momentous issues as whether "antiquated Senate rules" permit
 television monitors on the Senate floor. An accompanying WP front-pager
 explores the disillusionment of GOP voters with their party; libertarians
 especially are disaffected by the rabid pursuit of impeachment. The NYT
 off-lead weighs in with the renewed importance of the almost-dusty Starr
 Report, which will serve as the conveyor for much of the Senate evidence.

            The NYT says that the approximately $246 billion dividend owed to
 states by Big Tobacco is going to a slate of random causes such as sidewalk
 repair and paying off state debts--oh yeah, and health and anti-smoking
 programs too.
