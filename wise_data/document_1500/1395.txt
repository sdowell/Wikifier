                  Tuesday's Question
 (No. 212)--"Bad Chubbies":
               

               

                  
                     
                        Monday in federal court, Itsy Bitsy lawyers told a
 judge that Bubbly Chubbies must be destroyed.
 Why?
                     
                  
               

               
 "Because they refuse to sign the Kosovo peace agreement."-- Brooke
 Saucier ( Robert Rothman had a similar answer, but with sufficient
 whimsy to distract from the stench of death.)

               "Old
 Yeller bit them."-- Chris Thomas
               

               
 "They're much too butch."-- Jennifer Miller
               

               "That
 monologue writers might live."-- Chris Kelly
               

               
 "Because Bubbly Chubbies are made by exploited East Asian children, while Itsy
 Bitsies are made by exploited East Asian adults."-- Norm Oder

 Wrap-Up
               

            

            By rights, this story should have taken place in
 Japan, the most cuteness-loving country on earth and, coincidentally, the most
 pornography-laden nation on the planet and hence a popular destination for
 vacationing animated space monsters. With perky breasts. And huge, adorable
 eyes. Whose crazy adventures are recounted in comic books available in vending
 machines on the platforms of every Tokyo train station. So what are we to make
 of this Hello Kitty-porn juxtaposition?

            Betty Boop. That was the
 American manifestation of a big-eyed, baby-talking erotic ideal, a sexual
 fashion that's come and gone.
