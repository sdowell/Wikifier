            With the Di saga receding ever so slightly, news diversity makes a small
 comeback. So we have USA Today leading with the failure of an airline rate hike
 attempt, while the New York Times
 goes with Clinton vs. Gingrich on national educational testing, the Washington Post with a startling development in the Paula
 Jones lawsuit, and the Los Angeles Times leads with a local political
 story.

            With airlines flying at 77 percent capacity in August and the Dow Jones
 Transportation Index at record levels, it seemed like a good time for a 5
 percent fare increase, which, says USAT , most of the major domestic
 airlines put into place last week. But by last night, only two airlines still
 had it in all markets. USAT says that a computer system glitch
 mistakenly rolled back United Airline's increase in all markets and when
 American, Delta, and TWA saw that, they, fearing the loss of business from
 being underpriced, rolled their fares back too.

            The NYT reports that President Clinton has decided to make national
 educational standards testing a centerpiece of his second-term agenda. Clinton
 says his call for fourth grade reading tests and eighth grade math tests should
 be beyond partisanship. Yet, says the Times , Newt Gingrich and many
 other Republicans in the House and Senate see it as a federal intrusion into
 the schools. "The president is focused on the wrong end," Gingrich is quoted as
 saying. "He's focused on Washington bureaucracy, Washington regulations,
 Washington red tape." To avoid this sort of opposition, Clinton has emphasized
 that the tests would be voluntary and ultimately under the control of local
 school authorities. He has also said the tests could be designed by a
 bipartisan board. Some critics have said the problem is that the tests divert
 money away from actual educational improvements. They are estimated to cost $22
 million to develop.
