            Well, if people were expecting the end of summer to bring a return to
 high-volume trading and sharp price swings on Wall Street, they were certainly
 disappointed. The languor of the late summer carried over into this week, as
 the stock market meandered aimlessly (is there any way to meander aimfully?).
 The Dow is now just about where it was in early May. Interest rates are higher,
 but inflation looks just as dead, and corporate earnings are booming, and when
 you mix all that together, what you end up with is a market that looks to be
 about where it should be.

            Of course, this could all change tomorrow.

            There was only one story this week--Viacom and CBS--and unfortunately it was
 a story that got written four or five hundred times without anything really
 changing. So now we all get to look at NBC and wonder how long it'll be before
 it snaps up or is snapped up by a movie studio or something. It's almost like
 the 1980s, but thanks to 
 Mel Karmazin it's not. So on to the Cocktail Chatter.

            1. "Today was the day when the dreaded 9/9/99 bug was supposed to
 strike and mess up computers everywhere. But the bug was a nonstarter .
 There were no &$%@#($$$@#(( â€?Mayday! Mayday!"

            2. "The International Monetary Fund had planned to sell $2.5 billion of
 its gold stash to finance debt relief for poor countries, but has given up
 on that plan because the gold industry was worried that the sale would force
 down prices . It must be great to have a vault full of a useless metal
 that's valuable only because other people think it's valuable and then find out
 that other people think it's so valuable that if you sell it, the value will
 disappear."

            3. "Sun Microsystems introduced its 'revolutionary enterprise desktop
 appliance,' the Sun Ray 1, with a print ad featuring 27 lines and more than
 300 words of copy .
