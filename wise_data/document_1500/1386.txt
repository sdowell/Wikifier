            A year ago I was living in
 a $150,000 apartment, which I owned. It was a small, two-room apartment. Now I
 am living in a $175,000 apartment, which I own. It is also a small two-room
 apartment. In fact, it is the same apartment, although a little shabbier. A
 year ago I could have sold the apartment for $150,000. Now I can sell it for
 $175,000.

            Am I richer? I would
 have $25,000 more in cash if I sold today vs. a year ago. But money is a
 sterile thing, good only for what it will buy. Today's $175,000 will buy 62,724
 packages of Product 19, whereas last year's $150,000 would have bought only
 53,763 packages, so I am richer in Product 19. I do not, however, live on
 Product 19 alone.

            We are accustomed to the idea that we should convert all
 dollar amounts to "real" values by adjusting with the consumer price index.
 Because the CPI rose by 1.7 percent in the past year (January to January), the
 value of my apartment rose by only 14.7 percent in terms of the goods and
 services included in the CPI, rather than the 16.6 percent by which it rose in
 terms of dollars.

            But if I sell my
 apartment, I probably won't use the proceeds to buy that month's assortment of
 stuff that's in the CPI. I will probably want to buy some other asset that will
 yield a stream of income into the future. I could, for example, buy 30-year
 Treasury bonds. In March 1998 the $150,000 from my apartment sale would have
 bought bonds with a total yield of $8,925 a year. In March 1999 with $175,000 I
 can buy such bonds with a yield of $9,730 a year. In those terms I have got
 richer.

            But Treasury bonds are not what make everyone feel richer
 every day. I might want to be more venturesome in the hope of getting a
 larger--though riskier--income stream. Suppose I buy shares in the S&P 500
 Index. The price of that index rose 21.3 percent in the past year (to March
 11).
