            The Los
 Angeles Times and New York Times
 lead with the University of California's disclosure that as a result of
 Proposition 209's mandate to abandon affirmative action in admissions, the new
 freshman classes at its two most selective schools, Berkeley and UCLA, will
 have far fewer minority students than in the recent past. The Washington Post goes with the Supreme Court's decision
 allowing states to ban the courtroom use of polygraph results. USA Today
 leads with news that might be heartening for many users of the now withdrawn
 diet concoction Redux: a new study suggests that short-term use of the drug is
 not associated with an increase in heart valve problems. But the paper goes on
 to note that the study was sponsored by Redux's manufacturer and does not in
 any case address the consequences of long-term use.

            The University of California admissions situation is relayed most
 frantically at the LAT , which states that "the number of African Americans
 accepted by UC Berkeley has plunged 66% and the number admitted to UCLA dropped
 43%," without stating most of the raw numbers behind the percentages. (A common
 journalistic mistake/trick.) The WP does use the raw numbers when
 reporting on Berkeley, but unaccountably goes back to emphasizing percentages
 when discussing UCLA. The NYT also shies away from the actual numbers of
 students involved, but at least emphasizes the before-and-after-209 minority
 percentages of the total admitted pool, an illuminating datum. Both the
 LAT and NYT report that the minority drop occurred despite the
 university's decision to give extra consideration to poor applicants, thus
 proving that in California at least, class isn't race.

            One university official is quoted by the LAT as seeing in the shift
 the message that California's secondary schools must improve, while the paper
 has Prop.
