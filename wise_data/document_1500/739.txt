            The Washington Post leads with the black women's march in
 Philadelphia. The New York Times
 leads with a House committee's condemnation of the Pentagon's handling of Gulf
 War veterans' medical problems. The Los Angeles
 Times 's lead is a report that the U.S. strategy of isolating Iran and
 Iraq from the world community is failing as our allies' desire to make business
 deals weakens their support.

            The WP summarizes the rally's agenda: investigation of the CIA's role
 in "allowing black communities to be flooded with crack cocaine," programs to
 help women prisoners make the transition back to society, the establishment of
 black independent schools, and the release of political prisoners. In
 discussing crowd size, the Post uses as a reference the size of the
 Million Man March, but, curiously, doesn't refer to the Promise Keepers rally
 of a few weeks back--even though the paper gave PK massive front-page
 coverage.

            The rally coverage signifies an odd new journalism trend. In their extensive
 front-page coverage, the Post , the NYT , and the LAT
 dutifully report the size of the rally as "hundreds of thousands," yet they
 each persist in referring to the event as the "Million Woman March," apparently
 because that's what the organizers called it. So look for the Pentagon to call
 its next use of force "Operation Only Objected to by Draft-Dodging Reporters,"
 and don't be surprised when next summer's would-be blockbuster is called "The
 Best Movie You'll Ever See." (Question for William Safire: Why isn't it
 "Million Wom e n March" anyway?)

            The NYT lead is written off a copy it has obtained of a House
 committee's report to be released this coming week that says the Defense
 Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs should be stripped of their
 authority over Gulf soldiers' sickness because of their mishandling of the
 issue.
