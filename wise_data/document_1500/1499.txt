            He could have smacked
 youfor running out of gas, at midnight,in December, at a middle-of-nowhere
 place,coasting a few sorry yards toward home on the shoulderas a passing
 eighteen-wheeler's Hawaiian-sized wave of airwhomped the side of the car like a
 two-story pillow.As we sat there immobile--the four of us (including him),as if
 waiting for the show to begin at a surreal drive-in--he wanted to reach into
 the front seatand bonk your heads togetherthe way the leader of the Three
 Stooges didwhen the other two did something stupid.What had been road was now a
 cold placewithout a house light in sight in the rural South.What had been a
 passionate highway talkabout the culture's indifference to the artist's
 workwould have been silence except for himgiggling at us, at how danger
 dissolves discontentand flashes before us a life lost to pettiness,which we
 soon start to lose again."Who said there are no neurotics in wartime?"he
 planned to mock us with my voice, but when I got outto see where we were, he
 didn't. He brooded in the car.He didn't feel the pleasure of a skyful of
 starsso cold and clear when you look upits light illuminates your breath.Nor
 was he worried about anyone but himself,being the only one with nothing to
 worry about,not made of flesh. He was cryingI wanna go home inside the carlike
 a child trapped in a junked refrigerator.

            This was one
 time I felt exactly like him,as we three stood pondering our dilemma calmly,
 maturely.And I did again when he yelled I'm scaredas the clunker with wide
 headlights and bad muffler("Hell Wagon" or "Devil's Dream" no doubt inscribed
 on the fender--voted Car Of The Year by escaped convicts and serial
 killers)glided like a crocodile toward our throbbing, imported taillightsand
 idled there.
