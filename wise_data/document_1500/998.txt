            The New York Times leads with President Clinton's push for a
 new International Monetary Fund strategy to avert further global economic
 turmoil. The Washington Post 's lead forecasts that during Monday's House
 Judiciary Committee proceedings, more grounds for the impeachment of President
 Clinton will be added to the 11 counts currently pending. The Los Angeles
 Times leads with the story that preoccupies everyone's front: the
 latest act in the Lewinsky circus, namely the 4610 pages of evidence released
 yesterday by the House Judiciary Committee.

            The new three-volume set of documents includes excerpts from Linda Tripp's
 taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky and grand jury testimony from Vernon
 Jordan, Bettie Currie, Bruce Lindsey, and other key figures. With so many fresh
 details, it is hardly surprising that each paper emphasizes a different aspect.
 All papers note, however, that the new evidence does more to disclose the
 details we've all been wondering about than to substantively change the
 investigation.

            The papers also agree that the tapes portray Tripp as a manipulator, which
 plays into White House hands. (From the NYT analysis: The "friendship"
 between Lewinsky and Tripp seems "less a real friendship than a temporary
 alliance between two women obsessed with Bill Clinton who often do not even
 seem to like each other very much.") The LAT highlights the improbable
 assertions by Betty Currie, President Clinton's secretary, that despite hiding
 in the Oval Office bathroom during one of the Clinton-Lewinsky encounters
 (according to a synopsis of Tripp's account), she remained uncertain about the
 nature of the encounters: "I had a feeling, but I had nothing to base it on
 other than a gut." The WP fronts a story about strenuous efforts by
 Jordan and Lindsey to persuade Clinton to settle the Paula Jones lawsuit after
 Lewinsky testified.
