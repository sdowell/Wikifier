            May bad
 people see bad omens everywhere,

            The screech
 of an owl, the sight of a pregnant dog,

            Or a grey
 she-wolf running across a field,

            Or maybe a
 fox that's lately dropped her litter;

             

            Or may they
 see a serpent like an arrow

            Slither
 obliquely across, scaring the horses.

            My prayers
 will make good omens for good people.

            I'll look
 to the east and call upon the raven

             

            To sing
 good fortune to come to those I fear for,

            Before he
 has a chance to fly to the west,

            To the
 standing pools, to prophesy bad weather.

            Wherever it
 is your heart desires to go,

             

            Go safely
 there and be happy, Galatea,

            Remembering
 with pleasure how we were.

            Let no
 sinister magpie say you nay

            Nor any
 wandering crow forbid your journey.

             

            But you can
 see the tumult in the sky

            When angry
 Orion sets. You know how black

            The
 Adriatic can be, and what can go wrong

            Even when
 lapyx the favoring West Wind blows.

             

            O rather
 may our enemies' wives and children

            Experience
 the unexpected gales

            The South
 Wind brings upon them, the roaring of

            The
 blackening waters, the sound of the pounding surf

             

            Shaking the
 beaches. Thus it was for Europa,

            Entrusting
 the safety of her snow-white body

            To the not
 to be trusted bull when in the very

            Moment of
 her departure she was aghast

             

            At the
 midnight sea swarming with terrible monsters.

            She who had
 only a moment before that been

            A pupil of
 the flowers of the fields

            And a
 weaver of the garlands of the nymphs,

             

            Now all she
 saw in the blackness of the night

            Were the
 waves of the sea and the faint light of stars.
