            The Los
 Angeles Times leads with its over-the-weekend poll indicating that
 despite the Starr revelations, the public's support for Clinton remains rather
 robust. USA
 Today 's off-lead provides its weekend polling, with a similar upshot.
 The New York Times
 lead also looks at the popular reaction, summing it up as revulsion at
 Clinton's behavior, but reluctance to put the country through impeachment.
 USAT leads with the political reaction to the Starr report, claiming
 that over the weekend there was "no ground swell" in Congress for impeachment,
 although noting that prominent members from both parties called for censure of
 President Clinton, (a Washington Post front-pager also notes the congressional
 trend, while a NYT front-page story says this is becoming more
 acceptable to the Clinton camp as well). The WP , once again flashing its
 command of Beltway exits, leads with Sammy Sosa hitting two home runs to tie
 Mark McGwire.

            The LAT poll piece says just over 7 in 10 of those surveyed said the
 Starr report did not change their opinion of the president (of course, by
 itself, this means nothing, since they might have already thought he was an
 intern-bonking Mr. Hands). The poll also detects much public support for
 censure--34 percent. Censure gets the nod from 60 percent of USAT 's
 sample. A WP front-page story puts the censure rate at nearly six in
 ten. These polls suggest a clear majority of Americans want Clinton to remain
 in office--but USAT 's finds that 50 percent would favor impeachment if
 it could be proved that Clinton lied to the grand jury. Which is precisely what
 60 percent of those polled by the LAT think Clinton did. Wackiest stat:
 3 percent of the LAT sample say that after the Starr revelations, they
 now view Clinton more favorably. The LAT story puts the size of its
 sample--968 people--and its margin of error--4 percent--in its seventh
 paragraph.
