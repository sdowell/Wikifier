            Everybody leads with a federal judge's dismissal yesterday of the tax fraud
 case recently filed against Webster Hubbell by Kenneth Starr. The Los Angeles
 Times and Washington Post headlines put the matter flatly, speaking
 only of the dismissal itself. The USA Today
 headline goes further, stating, "Hubbell Ruling Hurts Starr on Whitewater." The
 New York Times
 goes further still, with the headline "In Slap at Starr, a Judge Dismisses
 Hubbell Tax Case," and a second front-page piece flagged "New Rebuke, And
 Harsher."

            The federal judge, James Robertson, whom all the papers note is a Clinton
 appointee, ruled that in pursuing the tax case against Hubbell, Starr exceeded
 his authority and strayed too far from his original mandate of investigating
 President Clinton's Arkansas real estate investments. Additionally, ruled the
 judge, Starr turned Hubbell into an informant against himself in basing the tax
 charges on records that Hubbell provided to him under a grant of immunity. The
 view of some of the papers that the ruling was a quite personal assessment of
 Starr is based in large measure on the judge's description of this records
 seizure as "the quintessential fishing expedition."

            The papers note that the adverse ruling is the latest in a string of
 setbacks for Starr: his failed attempt to eradicate the postmortem
 lawyer-client privilege, the death of cooperating witness James McDougal, the
 release from jail of the non-cooperating Susan McDougal, and his failure thus
 far to delve into communications between Clinton and his government-supplied
 lawyers or into the observations made of Clinton by his Secret Service detail.
 Most of the stories get a little lost among all these trees, with the
 LAT alone in high up clearly sighting the forest: the ruling will
 probably "make it more difficult for [Starr] to obtain evidence of alleged
 criminal wrongdoing by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton," Hubbell's former law
 partner.
