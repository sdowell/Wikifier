 across the front page of the Algerian government newspaper El Moudjahid ,
 referred not, as one might have expected, to the continuing massacres by
 Islamic extremists, which are reported to have claimed at least 600 dead since
 the holy month of Ramadan began Dec. 30, but to the agitation the killings have
 provoked in western Europe and the United States. "Only Paris has no Algeria
 plan," ran a headline in Germany's Die Welt over a story about France's fear of offending its former
 North African colony.

            Everyone
 else was urging Algeria to agree to an international commission of inquiry, an
 offer that it angrily rejected. El Moudjahid suggested that the
 countries trying to meddle in Algerian affairs "begin by worrying about the
 terrorists they harbour and protect in their own territories in the name of the
 right of asylum and the rights of man."

            The Vatican's official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano (ignoring the murder of a
 gentleman-in-waiting to the pope, which was given big play in all other
 European newspapers because of its apparent homosexual overtones), called for
 "a clear and decisive intervention" in Algeria to stop the massacres from
 sliding into "genocide." Most of the press in the Arab world remained silent on
 the subject, an exception being the Saudi daily Al-Jazirah, which
 appealed to Algiers "to accept the offers of Arab countries and to co-operate
 with them to study ways of pursuing the authors of these terrorist crimes."

            On the subject of terrorist
 crimes, the Daily
 Telegraph of London carried an op-ed feature by former Washington
 correspondent and veteran conspiracy theorist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard (whose
 Secret Life of Bill Clinton: The Unreported Stories was reviewed in

                  Slate
               ) under the headline "The Oklahoma Bomb: has justice been
 done?" It claimed that the Justice Department and the FBI had deliberately
 covered up the fact that the bombing had been a broad conspiracy, involving
 several other people, in order--for unexplained reasons--to put all the blame
 for it on Terry Nichols and Tim McVeigh.
