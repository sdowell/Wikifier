            Tim--

            I don't know what it's like outside your midtown-New York hotel room, but in
 downtown New York it's cold. As in 11 degrees cold. As in
 so-much-for-global-warming cold. As in

               -doesn't-pay-me-nearly-enough-to-go-outside-and-freeze-my-private-parts-off-to-get-the-newspaper
 cold.

            So that leaves me without much in the way of research as I try to comment on
 the day's events. But fortunately, I have a copy of yesterday's New York
 Daily News crumpled up in my gym bag. Let's see ... the front page story is
 ... it's cold outside. OK, well, I covered that in the paragraph above. Hmmmm
 ... not much else on the news front so let's see what my horoscope says: "Quiet
 time between you and your mate is very important. ... A new flame may break a
 date, but try to be forgiving." Well, that's no problem, because if my new
 flame stands me up, I'll have more time to spend with my mate instead of
 running off and cheating on her. See, this is the problem with reading
 yesterday's horoscope--it never makes any sense.

            OK, maybe I should try the Internet ...

            A USA Today /CNN Gallup poll finds that with no dominant issue amid an
 economic boom, this year's election could turn on candidates' personal
 qualities, as more than half the likely voters say a candidate's leadership
 skills and vision are what counts. The story goes on to say that if the
 election turns on personal characteristics, the Republicans should get a boost
 in the wake of the Clinton scandal.

            Huh? Wasn't that what they said in 1996 when, let's see, there were no
 issues amid an economic boom and the nation had supposedly grown tired of all
 the scandals surrounding Clinton? Yeah, we got so tired of him and his
 philandering ways we put him right back into office, and we knew what we were
 getting into.
