 Today leads with the angry reaction from many in business to the
 government's just-proposed guidelines for fighting workplace repetitive stress
 injuries. The Los Angeles Times lead covers essentially the same ground,
 while also explaining the difference between the new rules and current
 California law. Both stories report that the rules, which mandate various
 corrective actions at the first sign of injury, will cost companies an
 aggregate $4.2 billion per year. The Washington Post leads with the imminent release of the
 largest Pentagon study ever of racial attitudes within the uniformed military.
 The results are somewhat bracing for an institution that portrays itself as
 remarkably colorblind: some three-quarters of minority service members
 responding say they've experienced racism, and more than half doubted that
 discrimination complaints are thoroughly investigated. And the survey shows
 that military whites have a drastically more positive view. The paper quotes
 one defense official as saying the study was actually concluded two years ago,
 but release was delayed while the brass debated how to portray the results. The
 New York Times fronts the
 survey--adding that a second DOD report shows that black personnel get promoted
 at a much lower rate than whites--but leads instead with the news that the City
 University of New York has approved a plan that would bar remedial
 students.

            Both the USAT and LAT leads include criticisms from a vice
 president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who apparently was once told to give
 every reporter something unique. He tells the former that trying to implement
 the new workplace safety regs will be like getting your arms around a
 "marshmallow," and he tells the latter it will be like getting your arms around
 a bowl of "Jell-O." But the coverage itself suggests the squishiness of the
 subject matter.
