               SUNDAY'S NEW YORK TIMES
                says the Monica mess appears to have
 "blurred the boundaries between mainstream and tabloid news." Blurred? The
 lines have actually crossed in at least one instance. Time magazine
 semi-unflinchingly reported that Lewinsky said she could be "Special Assistant
 to the President for b___ j___." The supermarket tabloid Star was
 actually more decorous, describing Lewinsky's fantasy job title as "Special
 assistant to the president for (oral sex)." Even that was too much for the
 hoity-toity tabloid Globe , which said only that "Monica joked about her
 alleged romance by saying that she was 'special assistant to the president.'"
 That Monica! ....

            
               WITH MONICA WOBBLING SLOWLY IN THE WIND , the Kathleen Willey incident
 may now assume more importance. Do people realize just how creepy Clinton's
 behavior was, if the worst reported details of Willey's testimony are true?
 Here is a woman whose husband has been caught misappropriating funds, who must
 find a way to repay $274,000 within days. She's desperate (indeed, her husband
 would commit suicide before the deadline). She needs a job. She goes to see the
 president, who at this moment of temporary advantage takes her into a side room
 and gropes her breast and puts her hand on his genitals, saying he "always
 wanted" to do that. If true, this is not a consensual affair with Gennifer
 Flowers, or even a tryst with an employee like Monica Lewinsky. This is
 casting-couch piggishness of a sort that would make Bob Packwood blanch.

               WHAT IF CLINTON manages to survive? Consider the psychological
 effects on three groups of Washington characters:

            1) The Right Wing Conspirators: They thought they had him, but he slipped
 away again. Contempt for the electorate (and democracy) among this group will
 skyrocket.
