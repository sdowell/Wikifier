            Dear Eliza,

            The last time I had 14 drinks in different colors was this one evening in
 Vegas ... but that's neither here nor there. Last night I reprised our run over
 the bridge, trying several new bars, a different brand of goo, and a couple of
 drinks.

            My clearcut taste winner among the new bars was the Grabber Energy Bar in
 Wild Mountain Berry. Grabber must have some sort of French affiliation, as it's
 labeled "Barre D'Energie" and its ingredients list is bilingual. Leave it to
 the frogs to produce a tasty sports snack--Grabber had the taste and
 consistency of a thicker Fruit Roll-Up. And it's all-natural real fruit.
 Drawback: I don't quite understand why it's an energy bar, since it has barely
 any protein or fat. It does have 153 calories and 36 g of carbohydrates.

            I also tried the Clif Bar in Apricot flavor, which basically tasted like
 dried apricots, but mushier. Not bad. 250 calories and 2g of fat. I liked it
 better than the crunchy Clif Bar we tried yesterday. After this I went to the
 HardBody Energy Bar. The Honey-Almond flavor of this was yummy--I'd actually
 eat it as a snack even if I weren't exercising. Not surprisingly, it was a 280
 calories and a whopping 7g of fat. The Chocolate Truffle flavor HardBody had
 the same stats, but was less enjoyable. Chocolate Truffle is way too rich to be
 eating before or during exercise.

            During my run I felt good and energetic, and midway through I paused to try
 a different goo packet from the PowerGel I tried last night. This one is called
 Gu, and it was much more satisfying. Texture was like a nice custard, and
 flavor ("banana blitz") was mild and delicious. I actually felt better after
 the Gu than before. This may have something to do with its potassium, which
 helps maintain fluid balance and stop cramps. The goo packet market is
 exploding right now.
