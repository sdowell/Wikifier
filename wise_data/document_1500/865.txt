 Today , the New York Times ,
 and the Los Angeles Times lead with yesterday's unanimous Supreme
 Court decision that the law barring sexual discrimination in the workplace
 applies equally to harassment between workers of the same sex. The Washington Post , which runs the Supreme Court story near
 the top, goes instead with the most detailed account yet of President Clinton's
 deposition in the Paula Jones case. "Today's Papers" couldn't help but notice
 that President Clinton didn't comment on the important step the Supreme Court
 took to keep the workplace safe from sexual harassment.

            It's just common sense that same sex doesn't automatically mean no
 harassment, but the reporting on the decision makes it clear that the
 legalities have been murky. According to the NYT , the law of sexual harassment is basically a recent Supreme
 Court creation, and broadening its application has met with hostility in lower
 courts. The NYT reports that Justice Antonin Scalia's opinion for the
 Court--issued in the case of a male oil-rig worker complaining about his
 treatment by male co-workers--says the acid test for harassment is not the sex
 or motivation of the parties, but whether there is sex-based discrimination in
 the workplace "so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the
 victim's employment."

            Scalia, notes the Times , went on to claim that the decision does not
 abrogate all "genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and women
 routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the opposite sex," and
 all the papers give his example: a football coach slapping a player's rear on
 the way to the field would be lawful, while the same gesture directed at the
 coach's (female or male) secretary might not be. All the dailies note that the
 decision drew praise from civil rights and gay rights advocates.

            It's interesting to compare the harassment headlines.
