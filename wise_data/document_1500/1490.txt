            Don't look now (I said
 don't look !)

            I'll tell
 you when you can look), just lie back

            as if we were--well, as
 if

            we were
 talking . Try to behave

            as if we were by
 ourselves,

            that's why I
 brought you here in the first place.

            The trouble with these
 rooftop

            refuges--the
 one place in Tangier

            you can see a touch of
 green,

            something
 alive besides men and camels--

            the trouble is, there's
 always

            a roof
 higher than the one you're on,

            a man
 looking down, watching ...

            Why bother getting really

            comfortable
 if someone's ... In 
               any 
               case
            

            I'd never dream of
 dragging

            my best
 Bokhara out here--this old

            Ardabil is lovely still,

            they never
 lose their ... The colors are fixed

            by making the camels piss

            all over
 them, then washing them out

            in the canal: harsh
 treatment,

            you'd think,
 but it works--look at me !

            All the suppler for the
 way

            I've been
 manhandled, you must admit ...

            
               Now
 look: you see what I mean?

            That's a man up there,
 standing

            where he can
 ... No, not Mustapha! Someone

            he's put there to spy
 on us.

            On
 me ! What does it matter to him
            

            whether I'm up here with
 you

            or one of
 the bath-women? He has to

            
               know , that's all, it
 affords him

            some kind of
 gratification (more

            than he gets from
 anything

            he ever does
 with me!) .
