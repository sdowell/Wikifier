            Chatterbox was a bit surprised to see Susan Faludi's forthcoming book,
 Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man , get the
 red-carpet treatment from Newsweek . The magazine put Faludi on this
 week's cover, and inside ran a lengthy excerpt with no fewer than four sidebars (to read them, click
 here and here and here and here) and, to top it all off, an extremely sympathetic interview with the author. Perhaps Chatterbox wouldn't have been
 so surprised had he known that Faludi recently became a Newsweek
 contributing editor. But that's surprising, too.

            Why? Because Faludi's hugely successful previous book, Backlash , was in large part an attack on, well,
 Newsweek . Backlash is remembered as a broadside against 1980s
 culture as a whole, and (to quote its subtitle) its "undeclared war against
 American women." That culture is represented in Backlash mainly through
 the news media, which (if you read the book quickly) comes off as uniformly
 hostile toward feminism. But if you take a closer look, you'll notice that some
 news outlets come off worse than others. Faludi doesn't make a big deal of
 this, presumably because she never really intended Backlash to be a
 critique of particular news organizations so much as, well, a broadside against
 the culture as a whole. (That the culture as a whole quickly turned Faludi's
 book into a runaway best-seller has always suggested to Chatterbox that
 Backlash's thesis was an oversimplification.)

            According to Faludi's acknowledgements, Backlash began as a story for
 the San Jose Mercury News's Sunday magazine debunking an unpublished
 academic study by David Bloom, a Harvard economist, and Patricia Craig, a Yale
 graduate student, purporting to show that never-married college-educated women
 faced, at age 30, only a 20 percent chance of getting hitched in their
 lifetimes.
