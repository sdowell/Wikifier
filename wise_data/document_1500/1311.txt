            Love for President Clinton
 is undiminished in the Emerald Isle. Le Monde of Paris, over a report from Dublin, carried the
 headline "The Most Important Visit Since That of St. Patrick"--a quotation from
 a senior citizen in Armagh. The Irish Times, in an editorial Monday titled "Trouble Ahead for Mr Clinton," hoped he
 will survive his present crisis. "His visit here was exemplary in its political
 substance and confirmed the sure touch he continues to demonstrate on the
 Northern Ireland peace process," it said. The paper quoted his golf caddie in
 Ballybunion as saying, "This has been the greatest day of my life."

            In
 Belfast, Northern Ireland, the Catholic Irish News said that "although his trip helped strengthen
 the Irish peace process, it will be remembered for one thing: his first ever
 apology over the Monica Lewinsky scandal." The Irish Times read his
 statement on receiving the freedom of the city of Limerick--that he was pleased
 to know he could go there when he stopped being president--as a reference to
 the possibility that he might not stay in office for long.

            Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning last week
 that the United States cannot remain indefinitely untouched by the troubles in
 Asia and Russia aroused anxious comment around the world. London's Financial Times said in its main
 editorial Monday, "With US savings so low, and consumption sustained in good
 part by stock market gains, a continuing slump on Wall Street will slow growth
 as well as inflation. If this proves to be a correction, the Fed's task will
 become easier.
