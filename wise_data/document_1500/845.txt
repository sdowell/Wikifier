            Finally, after a solid week, some of the big dailies lead with monographs
 that aren't Monicagraphs. The Washington Post leads with the indictment of Clinton
 intimate Charlie Trie and another Democratic Party fund-raiser--the first in
 connection with the Department of Justice's investigation into the 1996
 campaign. (This story is the off-lead at the Los Angeles
 Times , but the New York
 Times runs it deep inside.) And the LAT goes with Madeleine
 Albright's pronouncement that if allies can't be convinced, the U.S. is ready
 to launch military strikes against Iraq on its own. Albright added that the
 diplomatic string is running out and reiterated the U. S. position: U.N.
 weapons inspectors must have unconditional access to Iraqi sites. (Elsewhere,
 this story doesn't get that much play either: at the NYT it only gets a
 reefer on the front page, below the fold.) USA Today
 leads with a new poll indicating the strength of President Clinton's
 post-scandal popular support, and the NYT goes with new details about
 the last White House meeting between Bill and Monica.

            
               USAT says its new poll (of 684 adults, done in concert with CNN and
 Gallup) shows that after his State of the Union speech, Clinton enjoys his
 highest approval rating ever--67 percent. The paper also reports that former
 White House chief of staff Leon Panetta was questioned yesterday by
 prosecutors. (This news is also flagged in the Wall Street Journal front-page news box and on the
 NYT front.) USAT also states that Starr investigators picked up
 evidence from a former teacher of Monica Lewinsky's, who says he had an affair
 with her.

            The paper also offers a glimpse into Monica's vie en scandale: long days
 sequestered in the Watergate with her mother, watching TV and talking on the
 phone in code. Her lawyer is quoted saying that she watched Clinton's SOTU
 address.
