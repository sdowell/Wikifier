            Dear Russ,

            I'm glad you mentioned the Send Key Syndrome. Writing
 these "reviews," in quick succession without the benefit of endless editing and
 rewriting, which is how I normally work (yes, Virginia, those "readable" books
 are the result of great effort), has brought home to me one quality of this
 sort of communication--it is really more like a street-corner conversation than
 anything else. Certainly not a debate, let alone an essay--or a considered book
 review for that matter. In fact, it is more like gossiping than anything else.
 So, perhaps 
                  Slate
               
 should rename this section Book Chat, or Book Rap, or something like that.

            Getting back to Celebration. I agree entirely that
 communities are cemented by adversity, although I don't think that absolves
 Disney from a royal screw-up with respect to the school. I can't think what
 they imagined when they marketed an "old-fashioned town" and then put in place
 an experimental school that would be considered radical even in communities
 such as Berkeley and Cambridge. Incidentally, Ross offers the interesting
 insight that it was Eisner himself, who is a supporter of nontraditional
 education, who had a lot to do with the revolutionary curriculum.

            Still, the question you ask is exactly right: How can a
 corporation that markets escapism make a real place? The answer, I suspect, is
 "with great difficulty." Which is the reason there will not be other Disney
 towns. Nor should there be, in my view. That is why the fears expressed by Ross
 and to a lesser extent by Frantz and Collins about corporate urbanism are
 misplaced. There won't be any towns built by mega-corporations like AT&T,
 Microsoft, or Pepsico. Of course, all master-planned communities are built by
 corporations, but they are relatively small organizations that specialize in
 "creating community.
