            We are having a hurricane watch in our house, and all activity has halted
 while we try to figure out whether the weather people know what they're talking
 about and whether it is safe to use Fed Ex (which flies through Memphis) and
 whether the contractor for our Long Island house ever fixed the front door that
 doesn't close. The last time there was a hurricane we were in the house on Long
 Island, and the police came and actually said the words "Seek higher
 ground."

            Which brings me to today's Duff-Perelman news: Ms. Duff has hired two new
 lawyers, bringing the total of lawyers she has employed to 23, and the
 22nd of them is the divorce lawyer who argued the custody case in
 the divorce of the 21st lawyer, who was still on the case this
 morning, but not for long. I know the 21st lawyer and have watched
 horrified as he argued that anyone's 5-year-old deserves a $26,000 antique
 desk, so I hope he has learned something.

            Here is a serious thing for a moment: The world is full of women who can't
 get their husbands to pay child support, and it won't be long before even the
 ones on food stamps will be attacked by their ex-husbands' lawyers for being as
 greedy as Patricia Duff.

            Lawyers are fascinating things, aren't they? Thomas Puccio, once someone I
 admired, took the case of that rapist-who-went-on-the-lam from Connecticut, and
 tried to smear his accuser. And there's Marvyn Kornberg, who (fortunately) lost
 for his client in the Louima case, but not before he had stood up in court and
 accused Louima of being sodomized not by his client but by consensual sex in a
 gay bar. Lawyers always fall back on the time-tested everyone-deserves-a-lawyer
 thing, everyone-is-entitled-to-a-defense, but the truth is there's no excuse
 for what these lawyers say in court-- for which they never ever even seem to
 say they're sorry .
