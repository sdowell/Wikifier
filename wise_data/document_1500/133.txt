            Before we get to this week's Cocktail Chatter, I have a correction to make.
 In Tuesday's column about the Federal Reserve's use of symbolic action to guide
 interest rates in the right direction, I wrote that the Fed's adoption of a
 neutral bias was a shift from its earlier stance. In fact, the Fed had already
 adopted a neutral bias at its previous meeting, shifting from a bias toward
 tightening. What threw me was that it's relatively unusual for the Fed to raise
 interest rates off a neutral bias, but that is in fact what happened this week.
 The bond market, meanwhile, seemed so concerned about inflation that it felt as
 if the Fed was leaning toward tightening. (Which it did do.) So when the Fed
 announced that it was staying neutral, it felt like a change.

            All of the above is true, but I still shouldn't have made the mistake.
 Apologies.

            In no small part because of that interest-rate hike, it was a roaring week
 in the stock market. Before today's minor sell-off, the Dow had been up 3.3
 percent in the previous seven trading days, while the Nasdaq was up an amazing
 7 percent. It used to be that interest-rate hikes were automatic bad news for
 stocks, since the idea behind the hike is that it will slow down the economy
 and, presumably, profits. But this economy seems so strong that the danger of
 having the boom killed by inflation--which would eventually lead to very sharp
 interest-rate hikes-- feels more powerful than the danger of having the boom
 killed by a slowdown. So as long as the interest-rate hikes remain manageable,
 the stock market welcomes them. Who knows how long this will last, but right
 now, investors seem to feel that if things are stable, the only answer is to
 buy. You can't keep a buoyant market down. Which is, I suppose, why you would
 call it "buoyant." Anyway, on to the Chatter.
