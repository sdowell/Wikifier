            Dear Steve:

             Wow, I'm still reeling over
 yesterday's military coup in Pakistan. Less than two weeks ago, my film critic
 pal and I were quaffing sodas (no beers in this Islamic republic, remember?)
 poolside at the Pearl Continental Hotel in downtown Rawalpindi, running around
 Gilgit in disputed Kashmir Province and fending off aggressive beggars on the
 overnight sleeper train to Karachi. Certainly there were lots of signs of
 political and economic instability: Some of the hotels recommended in our
 Lonely Planet guide had closed in the last year, inflation was literally eating
 away the rupee by the hour, and Pakistanis, described universally as cheery to
 the point of being irritating, were cranky and mean--especially when they heard
 our American twangs.

            But as I reported on my radio show for the first time
 back then, the big news is that the Pakistani government has apparently signed
 a devil's bargain with the militant Taliban from neighboring Afghanistan.
 They've opened the border between Afghanistan and Pakistani-held Kashmir to let
 mujahadeen guerillas in to fight the Indians all summer long. The Taliban,
 who've earned a reputation as the new Khmer Rouge by stoning adulterers to
 death and denying medical care to women, aren't the most subtle guys in the
 world--heavily armed goons have set up checkpoints along the main highway
 between Kashmir and China and now occupy between a third and half of Kashmir on
 the Pakistani side of the Line of Control; the only thing saving Cole and me
 from a night as the star attraction at the Talidrome was our bus's own heavily
 armed guard.

            That same week, two major Pakistani political parties
 called for Taliban-style rule in Pakistan to bring stability and "real" Islam
 to the masses. What you have to understand about Pakistan is that it's a
 democracy in name only; even before yesterday it was a barely disguised
 military junta backed with American tax dollars.
