            Both the New York Times
 and the Los Angeles Times lead with yesterday's revelation that a
 special House committee's secret report concludes that over the past two
 decades American companies have transferred significant amounts of military
 technology to China, thereby damaging U.S. national security. This story is
 also the off-lead at the Washington Post , which leads instead with Sen. Trent Lott's
 proposed plan for a streamlined and quick impeachment trial, and at USA Today ,
 which leads instead with polling showing an easing of Americans' fears about
 Y2K. Despite any general Y2K calming, a Wall Street Journal front-pager notes a dawning realization
 among technology workers: come next New Year's Eve, many of them will be not at
 parties, but at work monitoring their computers' Y2K performance.

            The NYT , LAT and WP note that the China report was unusually bipartisan, receiving unanimous
 committee approval and finding Chinese acquisition of military secrets
 transpiring during Republican and Democratic administrations alike. The
 WP sees in the findings a criticism of the Clinton administration policy
 of loosening export restrictions, which, according to the papers, the committee
 wants re-cinched. But the WSJ points out that the pot-and-kettle aspect
 of the findings may help deflect criticism of Bill Clinton. The congressional
 report, prompted by a NYT story last spring describing the unsupervised
 flow of sensitive satellite technology to China's strategic rocket programs,
 confirmed that transfer, but, say the papers, went much further, also
 uncovering the theft by the Chinese of nuclear weapons design technology from
 American labs and examining the too-loose export controls governing advanced
 computers. Also included was a look at the covert donations to American
 political campaigns made during the 1996 election by a Chinese aerospace
 executive.
