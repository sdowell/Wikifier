            Nuclear proliferation is the story of the day. Pakistan's possible imminent
 test of a nuclear bomb leads at USA Today, and the Washington Post, and is also the subject of a Wall Street Journal piece tipped high in the paper's front-page
 news box. The confirmation by experts that last week India detonated a hydrogen
 bomb leads at the New York Times. And the Los Angeles Times
 goes with the Group of Eight's struggle to devise a nuclear strategy.

            Pakistan's foreign minister said Sunday that despite appeals from President
 Clinton and other world leaders, his government has decided to conduct a
 nuclear test, reports USAT , the NYT and the WSJ . And this
 is what the USAT and WSJ headlines say. But the papers also
 report that others in the government say the decision has not been made yet.
 WP quotes Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who had just left
 Pakistan, as saying that his delegation left believing the Pakistanis were
 still undecided. The LAT sums up the situation with its off-lead
 headline "Pakistan Sends Mixed Signals." President Clinton is quoted by
 USAT saying that a Pakistan test is "a nutty way to go." The G-8 summit
 refused to follow Clinton's lead and impose sanctions against India, reports
 USAT , instead issuing a resolution condemning its nuclear testing. The
 LAT calls this a "toothless statement."

            Meanwhile, according to USAT and the NYT , India ratcheted the
 situation with its announcement that its nuclear missile program is all but
 ready. The Times explains this means the country now has a nuke that can
 be delivered from a plane, or launched from the ground or the sea. According to
 Indian scientists, says the NYT , the hydrogen bomb (code-named Shakti-1,
 from the Hindi word for "power") they set off is considerably smaller than the
 largest hydrogen bombs tested by the U.S., Russia and the other established
 nuclear powers.
