            This is my summer schedule, which is basically no schedule at all ... my
 daughter, who's 15, is away at camp; the two of us are rattling around the
 house with no classes, meetings, etc., to worry about ... closest thing to
 nirvana except for places like the McDowell Colony, where they give you meals
 and bring lunch to your studio door.

            On Columbine, before I forget: I don't, in general, buy as a sufficient
 explanation for media obsessions that "it's all about ratings and selling
 papers," for two reasons. First, because you have to ask why huge numbers of
 people are so interested that they watch the TV shows and buy the papers. And
 second, because the money explanation assumes a detached cynicism--or a totally
 mechanical subservience to their bosses' interests--on the part of the
 reporters, editors, producers, etc., who are responsible for the actual
 coverage, when in fact journalists are caught up in the same fears and
 fantasies as their audience. As I see it, Columbine hit more of a cultural
 chord than the Atlanta murders because Americans are in turmoil about children
 and teen-agers: On the one hand, everyone's political agenda is rationalized as
 protecting children, whether it's censorship and drug testing or welfare and
 gun control; on the other, adults are fearful of young people, feel that
 they're out of control, and at the same time guilty about the many ways kids
 are being shortchanged in this enormously pressured, work-obsessed, and uptight
 environment.

            Speaking of drug testing, according to today's Times , the ACLU has
 taken on the case of high-school kids in a "small rural town" in Oklahoma who
 are forced to take urine tests if they want to participate in extracurricular
 activities or take the classes that are, in some cases, connected with these
 activities. Aside from the travesty against the Fourth Amendment, this is just
 another example of the paranoia and contempt aimed at teen-agers.
