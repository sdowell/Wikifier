            The dramatic court fight over just how secret the Secret Service is supposed
 to be--going today to the desk of Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist
 at the request of the DOJ--leads at USA Today and
 the Washington Post . The New York Times
 and Los
 Angeles Times lead instead with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s decision, in
 the face of government antitrust objections, to abandon its planned $8.3
 billion acquisition of the Northrop Grumman Corp.

            Rehnquist, who handles emergency matters for the Washington federal courts
 (and who, the papers note, is coming into town from Innsbruck, Austria, where
 he was teaching a summer course) is getting the case of what to do about subpoenas issued by Kenneth Starr
 to several members of President Clinton's Secret Service protective detail
 because yesterday a federal appeals court unanimously refused to quash them.
 Some of the language used by the appeals court judges was quite strident. "The
 president's agents have literally and figuratively declared war on the
 independent counsel," wrote one, quoted all around. The WP calls the
 appeals court pass a "resounding defeat" for the Clinton administration.

            The papers note that top presidential bodyguard Larry Cockell--pictured on
 the USAT , WP and NYT top fronts--was so distracted by the
 events that he accepted being temporarily relieved of his presidential duties
 until the matter is resolved. Cockell's lawyer tells the Post that
 "being compelled to testify goes against everything he's been trained to do,"
 but that on the other hand, "He's a law enforcement official....He's not about
 to go with a contempt route or lie."

            
               USAT says today's involvement of Rehnquist amounts to a "high noon
 showdown" between the Clinton administration and Kenneth Starr, and that the
 issue of Secret Service confidentiality is the most contentious issue yet in
 Starr's investigation of Lewinsky's relationship with Clinton.
