            The
 sentencing to death for murder and treason of the Kurdish separatist leader
 Abdullah Ocalan was the top story Wednesday across Europe, with practically all
 newspapers urging the Turkish government to call off his execution. An array of
 editorials in France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Spain trotted out much the
 same arguments: Hanging Ocalan would ignite more Kurdish violence in Turkey and
 further strain Turkey's relations with the countries of the European Union,
 which it wants to join. It was also widely claimed that the arrest and
 conviction of Ocalan offers a rare opportunity for Turkey to negotiate a peace
 settlement with its rebellious Kurdish minority.

            In
 Britain, the Times proposed a do-nothing policy "until today's passion and
 polemics fade away." It said: "Formally commuting the death sentence might, for
 now, strike Turkish voters as weak. But if Ocalan was alive, in prison, with a
 death sentence over his head, the PKK [his Kurdish Workers' Party] might
 exercise more restraint: meanwhile, the Turkish Government might win time for a
 broader approach to the Kurdish question." The liberal Guardian said it would be
 "greatly in Turkey's interest" to embark on a dialogue with the Kurds. It said:
 "The Kurdish question, the existence of which Ankara officially denies,
 continues in reality to disrupt its internal affairs. ... It has hampered
 Turkey's ambition to join the EU, and raised concerns about its NATO
 membership. The constant stream of condemnation of Turkey's oppression of its
 Kurdish minority poisons daily its commerce with the world." The Independent said that
 although Ocalan was no saint or democratic hero, hanging him would only make
 things worse by turning him into a martyr for the Kurdish cause.

            In
 Germany, Die Welt led
 on European indignation at the death sentence and appeals for Turkey to commute
 it.
