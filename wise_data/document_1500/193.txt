            Yes, it's a red-letter Duff-Perelman day in New York, especially the
 $30,000-a-month-for-domestic-help item in her proposed budget. This is a
 statistic that has affected me in the following way: I was appalled, and then,
 shortly thereafter-very very shortly thereafter-I began to think about how nice
 it would be to have that much domestic help.

            But to get back to your question yesterday about Ron Perelman (and the Ron
 Perelmans of the world), why is it that men (sorry, Kurt) are so obtuse about
 this? I can't tell you how many men ask this question. I mean, don't you know
 a) that Ron Perelman is kind of cute and b) that everyone sleeps with everyone
 for all sorts of reasons and c) if only conventionally handsome men got laid,
 this would be a seriously underpopulated world. As they say, there's a cover
 for every pot, or something like that. Of course they also say it's as easy to
 marry a rich man as a poor man, and that is definitely not true.

            By the way, one of my sister Delia's most brilliant observations on life,
 and one that someone should have told Patricia Duff (not that she would have
 listened) is this: Never marry a man you wouldn't want to be divorced from.

            The article in the Wall Street Journal reminds me, once again, how
 much I wish Tom Brokaw would run for president. It would be one of the few
 times I could genuinely be thrilled about the seamless blah-blah between
 politics and entertainment. Why can't we get a groundswell going? And don't you
 think Warren Beatty expected to be nominated by popular acclaim by now? That
 story was truly a three-day wonder.

            I am struggling hard with the Hillary thing. Of course I will vote for her,
 etc., but I've been stunned at how many of my friends, my women friends, my
 women-who-are-Democrats-and-successful friends, have no enthusiasm for her
 candidacy at all.
