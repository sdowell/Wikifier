            The business section of Sunday's New York Times had a quiet, but
 definitive, feel of "Apocalypse Soon," featuring as it did three different
 columns arguing that the stock market was patently overvalued, that this
 overvaluation would eventually be corrected--perhaps in the form of a
 crash--and that that crash would have dramatic ripple effects on the rest of
 the economy as a whole even if, as seems certain it would, the Federal Reserve
 were to step up and cut interest rates to keep liquidity in the system.

            On a day when the Nasdaq rose 127 points to yet another record high, putting
 it up 77 percent on the year, this scenario may seem more plausible than ever.
 But what's interesting is that even if you set the question of overvaluation
 aside--and it is a much more complicated question than anyone at the
 Times ever seems to acknowledge--and accept that some form of market
 correction is in the offing, it's really not clear that a major correction
 would have such a dramatic impact on the economy as a whole.

            It's not clear because the evidence for a causal relationship between a
 booming stock market and a booming economy remains surprisingly scanty. For the
 most part, it's accepted that there is such a thing as a "wealth effect,"
 whereby some percentage of every dollar people make in the stock market is
 turned into consumption. But the magnitude of that wealth effect has, at least
 in the past, been shown (insofar as something like this can be shown) to be
 relatively small, on the order of three to five cents in additional spending
 per dollar. Over the past few years, as the economy has grown at a much faster
 than anticipated rate and the stock market has also risen sharply, the media
 and Wall Street seem to have assumed that the size of the wealth effect has
 also increased, and that more of every dollar in market gain is being turned
 into consumption (which in turn drives the economy).
