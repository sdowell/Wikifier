            Dear Dad,

            For as long as I can remember, more than 25 years, reporters have been
 asking you to make predictions about the future. And you have always given an
 answer along the lines of what you told the ABC producer yesterday. It's
 convincing, and sober, and intellectually responsible, and it frustrates them
 to no end. Just once, perhaps, you should give them what they want. "Watch for
 the invention of flying cars in 2006, which will drastically affect the course
 of World War III when it breaks out in 2008. There'll be a Mars colony by 2020.
 And by the way, make sure to sell all your Xerox stock by next Wednesday."

            More seriously, I have one question for you about all of this, and one
 demurral. The question concerns patterns of technological change. As a lot of
 commentators have been noting recently, the future isn't what it used to be.
 When I was a kid, visions of the future were heavy on, yes, flying cars and
 Mars colonies and the like. Everyone was confidently predicting that by the
 year 2000 the human race would be well on its way to settling the solar system,
 while at home we'd be casually buzzing from continent to continent in our cars,
 and the robot servants took care of cleaning the house.

            These seemed reasonable enough predictions, actually, given the pace of
 change up till then in the 20 th century. It's hard to believe that
 in just 66 years, less than a lifetime, we went from Wilbur and Orville Wright
 on the beach at Kitty Hawk to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon. 66
 years! If that pace of change had continued, I would probably have been sending
 you this e-mail from Jupiter orbit. But it didn't continue. In fact, it's hard
 not to think that in a lot of areas, technological change has slowed to a
 crawl, with incremental improvements around the edges, but no great leaps
 forward.
