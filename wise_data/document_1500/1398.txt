               Two
 Liars
            

            Of the two, Bill Clinton is
 the bigger liar, we suppose, but Ken Starr may be the more brazen. Clinton's
 "that woman" lie at least was a sincere attempt to keep us in the dark. Starr,
 by contrast, seems to think he can mislead us about truths that are right in
 front of our eyes. And maybe he can.

            
 Wednesday's New York Times , for example, carried excerpts from Starr's
 letter to Clinton's lawyer David Kendall explaining why he would not give
 Kendall an advance peek at Starr's report to Congress. "As you doubtless know,"
 Starr wrote, "this Office steadily has maintained the position that it would
 not be appropriate to comment on the possibility that it would provide a
 'report' to Congress." Naturally it is impossible to let Kendall see the report
 in advance if you have a steadily maintained position that you don't even
 concede the "possibility" that such a report exists.

            That was on Page A18 of the national edition. Meanwhile, on
 Page A1 ("Report by Starr Against Clinton Expected Soon") of the same paper,
 the "possibility" of a " 'report' " from Starr was getting very different
 treatment. Starr "plans to deliver a report" quite soon, and he "intends to
 alert Speaker Newt Gingrich" that very day that the report contains "credible
 grounds for impeachment." The report "is expected to outline ... will almost
 certainly say ... is likely to include ..." and so on. Says who? Say "allies of
 Mr. Starr" and "lawyers familiar with Mr. Starr's plans" and so forth.

            Despite the coy labeling,
 this information could come from only one of two places: someone's imagination
 or Starr's office. And since the info has proved to be accurate, the first
 option defies probability. Starr has said he disapproves of leaks, but leaks
 have gushered out of his office before and since, and no one has been caught
 and fired.
