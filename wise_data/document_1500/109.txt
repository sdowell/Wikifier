            Dear Kara,

            OK, I'll bite. How will the Internet become the "most important
 communications medium of all time"? How will it sweep away ignorance about
 racial hatred or empower people to take control of their lives? It seems to me
 that the Internet can foment hate and/or the herd mentality just as easily at
 it can foment tolerance and/or empowerment. I have to put my cards on the table
 here: I'm really skeptical of the claims that I hear all around me about how
 the Internet is going to change the world as we know it.

            Let me lay out some of the reasons for my skepticism. First, from a purely
 historical point of view, I don't see how anyone can view the Internet as more
 important than any number of communications media that have preceded it: the
 printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph player, the
 television among them. To my mind, the Internet is demonstrably less
 important--less transforming, if you will--than any of these predecessors.
 Secondly, more often than not, powerful new technologies don't live up to their
 supposed "true" potential. Here, of course, television is the prime example.
 Look back at the claims that were made for television during its formative
 years, and they sound a lot like the claims being made now for the Internet.
 Would anyone claim today that television has changed our society? Well, yes,
 they would--but not in the enlightened fashion that its proselytizers had once
 hoped.

            I know you're not supposed to say this out loud--at least not on a
 respectable Web site like this one--but I think the Internet has a way of
 bringing out the worst in people rather than the best. The anonymity it allows
 emboldens people to say things to each other they would never say face to face.
 There are at least as many sites for nuts as there are for people trying to
 make the world a better place.
