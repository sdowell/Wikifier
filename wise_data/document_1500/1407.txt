 Wrap-Up
            

            Judging by News Quiz
 participants--and I do--the two groups likeliest to express nasal disdain are
 film critics and political opponents. This is a disturbing ceding of the field
 to professionals. It is, for instance, the right of every American to carp
 about his boss (I believe that's in the Constitution) and his relatives (the
 Bible). But there is a recent reluctance to fire at certain targets unless one
 has impressive credentials, a professionalizing of contumely. This is
 lamentable and unnecessary.
