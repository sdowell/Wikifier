            Dear Brent--

            I guess this is it--our last exchange. In a way, I feel as if the
 conversation is only just getting started. Though we turn out to agree about a
 surprising number of things, we also disagree--in ways that I'm not sure we've
 really gotten to.

            Take preferences, for example. I don't think that's just a trick of the
 tongue. There's a real difference between affirmative action as it was
 initially defined (an effort to expand the recruitment pool and make sure that
 there is no discrimination in the hiring process) and what is generally
 practiced today: flagrantly color-coded double standards. I believe college
 admissions offices and corporate personnel departments do literally prefer to
 admit and hire people of color for certain slots. In fact, it's stronger than
 "prefer"--they make sure they do. Otherwise, you wouldn't have 200-point gaps
 in average black and white SAT scores at many colleges. And here, once again, I
 go back to the question of means and ends. Of course, as you say, "some racial
 mixture is socially desirable." I couldn't be more eager to see a thoroughly
 diverse student population and an integrated workforce, from top to bottom. But
 I don't think preferences are the right way to get there. And I believe it's
 very helpful to have terms to distinguish the tools that you find useful from
 the ones you feel are counterproductive or downright pernicious.

            (But by the way, I thought from one of your earlier messages that you too
 were ambivalent about preferences?)

            Be that as it may, we did--I thought--agree on the much more important,
 underlying point: that, like them or not in the short term, preferences must
 eventually be replaced by better education for minorities. My problem here: I'm
 not sure it's a simple as you think. I agree it's unclear what to do about bad
 parenting.
