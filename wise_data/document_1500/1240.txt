               Hotel Ballroom ,
 produced by Paul Wolfe, Jeff Iorillo, Corey Stolberg, and Robert Gondell of
 Foote, Cone & Belding in San Francisco.

            The inevitabilities of age
 dictate that Generation Xers grow up, get a job, and go places--whether they
 want to or not. But the age-old question remains: What to wear? This spot,
 Hotel Ballroom , produced for Levi Strauss by Foote, Cone & Belding,
 suggests to Gen-Xers that your pants can have the same attitude as you--still
 young (they're Levi's, but not jeans), and a good fit; comfortable in your own
 identity, yet at ease in the establishment world. Well, just enough to get
 by.

            At first look, we don't know
 what the ad's about. We see a twentysomething guy, wearing a tie but no coat
 (it's in the garment bag--wear it only when you have to), entering a grand
 hotel. The lobby, which is shot in black and white, possesses a grandeur seldom
 seen today outside beaux-arts train stations. There's a sense of
 something older in this space, but not of the past. It's the time-space of
 grown-up commitments, where the Gen-Xer has to live--at least part time. Maybe
 color is reserved for nights and weekends. But even in the black-and-white
 world, the Gen-X attitude is still evident. The clerk, initially seen upside
 down, hints at a world turned on its head.

            As the guy in the pants
 approaches the desk, the clerk accepts that he belongs. Like the pants, our
 hero fits--but in his own way. With a wan smile, he asks for the phone. The
 clerk half-reluctantly points it out. He can't question the Gen-Xer, who's
 carrying an attaché case; this guy could be anything, even a young computer
 mogul.

            As he strides toward the
 phone, we hear the narrator's voice for the first time: "You know those pants
 that always fit ..." But our hero doesn't find the phone; he gets a little
 lost.
