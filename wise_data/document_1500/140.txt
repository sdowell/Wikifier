            As has become usual, Alan Greenspan's speech last Friday at the gathering of
 the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyo., has been ardently
 scrutinized by both the financial press and investors anxious to figure out
 whether the Federal Reserve is planning to raise interest rates anytime soon.
 What's occasioned the most notice, fittingly enough, was Greenspan's argument
 that central bankers needed to pay attention to asset prices--like, oh, the
 stock market--in addition to the prices of normal goods and services if the
 bankers want to have a handle on what may drive inflation in the future.

            Some commentators have also remarked that Greenspan's speech, far from being
 "a stark warning," as Reuters termed it, was a tempered acknowledgement that
 even central bankers have a hard time figuring out when markets are overvalued.
 That, in turn, suggests that Greenspan understands now that his "irrational
 exuberance" speech of three years ago was precisely what it was, one person's
 attempt to outthink a market that it is very difficult to outthink. What's
 especially curious about this is that one would have thought this was a
 conclusion a supposedly ardent devotee of the free market would have reached a
 long time ago.

            Greenspan, of course, has never ascribed to himself (at least not in
 public--who knows what he thinks as he sits contentedly in his bathtub) the
 level of wisdom and farsightedness that the media have come to grant him. His
 remarks are typically shrouded and hedged, and though it is of course the job
 of the Fed to restrain inflation and promote economic growth, which requires
 him to make at least educated guesses about the future, Greenspan generally
 does seem well aware of the limits of his own knowledge.

            This is as it should be, since a fundamental principle of a free-market
 economy is that the market knows more than any individual within it.
