            Hello, Sweetie--

            The Mets win! Also, as long as I'm on parochial issues, it is freezing cold
 here, and the radiators in my apartment are making those knocking and
 whispering noises that make all prewar buildings in Manhattan seem like they
 were built on Native American graveyards. Furthermore, there is yet another
 Op-Ed piece in the New York Times today on the Brooklyn Museum show,
 this one by Philippe de Montebello, in which he characterizes the works on
 display there as by artists "who deserve to remain obscure or be forgotten,"
 boldly opining, "I have seen the exhibition, and I think the emperor has no
 clothes." Strong words for a man whose institution not long ago devoted a
 heavily promoted show to the designs of Gianni Versace featuring such
 culturally important artifacts as the famous safety-pin-adorned dress worn by
 Elizabeth Hurley to, I believe, the premiere of Four Weddings and a
 Funeral .

            I like your conspiracy theory, but where most such theories fall apart on
 the unlikelihood of the conspirators being sufficiently organized to carry off
 such a thing, yours falls apart on the unlikelihood of any alternative
 candidate's being sufficiently disorganized not to understand the benefits of
 serving the interests of corporate oil. Also, while I don't like to quibble, I
 don't think W. is a self-admitted cokehead. Did you happen to catch Sam
 Donaldson's interview with a tearful George Bush senior on 20/20 last
 night? I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that you frequently see
 grittier reporting on VH1's Behind the Music , especially the part where
 Bush was so overcome with emotion while reading a letter he wrote to a
 7-year-old girl whose father had been killed in battle during his
 administration that he was unable to continue, and had to hand the task over to
 the Donaldson (on 20/20 --that's never happened on Behind the
 Music , although I didn't watch every minute of the one on Poison, so you
 never know).
