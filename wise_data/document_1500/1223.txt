      Dear Mr. Business Owner:
      Community needs are everyone's business. How a community pulls
      together to help those in need defines that community as a good place to
      live, a good place to raise a family, and a good place to do
      business.
      In our community, there is a partnership that pulls together every
      year to meet urgent needs, and helps ensure that central Indiana
      continues to be a good place to live, work and do business - the
      partnership between businesses like yours, United Way of Central Indiana,
      and its family of 82 human service agencies. I am writing to ask you, as
      a business leader, to invest in our community by contributing to this
      partnership through United Way of Central Indiana.
      By investing in the community through this partnership, you can help
      more than 220,000 people in central Indiana next year. United Way
      agencies are there for everyone--you, your family, your friends, and your
      employees. In fact. United Way agencies can help your employees by
      providing services that may not be available elsewhere. such as:
      low-cost daycare, children's recreation, scouting, and other youth
      activities, emergency and disaster relief, counseling for victims of
      domestic violence and abuse, screening for cancer, heart disease, and
      other conditions, and more.
      By supporting United Way, you are ensuring that these important
      services continue. You'll also be making a good investment.
      $1.00 invested in drug-and-alcohol treatment saves $11.00 in later
      costs of crime, unemployment, and other social problems.
      $1.00 invested in preschool education for a disadvantaged child saves
      $4.75 in later special education, welfare payments, crime, and other
      costs.
      $1.00 invested in a job-training program for a person on welfare saves
      $3.
