            The House Judiciary Committee's vote to recommend impeachment for President
 Clinton leads at all the papers. The HJC approved 3 articles of impeachment
 late Friday afternoon by votes of 21-16, 20-17, and 21-16. The articles accuse
 the President of: 1) lying before the Lewinsky grand jury, 2) lying under oath
 in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, and 3) obstructing justice by
 attempting to influence witnesses in the Lewinsky case. Committee members voted
 the party line with the exception of Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who voted
 against impeachment for lying in a civil case. The papers all note that the
 votes came just minutes after another Clinton apology, this time from the White
 House Rose Garden, in which he expressed profound regret, asked for a censure
 from Congress, and, once again, did not admit to lying under oath. The
 committee will vote on the fourth article, which alleges abuse of power, on
 Saturday morning.

            The Washington Post says the timing of the vote, which came
 immediately after Clinton's apology, lent "a dramatic-some said surreal-quality
 to the moment of judgement." All the papers mention that Clinton now joins
 Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon as the third president to face impeachment.
 The New York Times
 points out that the events leading up to the House's vote next week began as "a
 civil sex harassment suit by an obscure Arkansas civil servant."

            The weekend papers all feature front-page articles on a second-hand effect
 of suing tobacco companies: rich lawyers. An arbitration panel has awarded a
 total of $8 billion to attorneys who successfully sued tobacco companies on
 behalf of three states. The WP reports that the individual award of $3.4
 billion, which will be split among the 11 firms that represented Florida, is
 the largest fee ever in U.S. history. The NYT reports that 5 Texas
 lawyers will split fees of $3.
