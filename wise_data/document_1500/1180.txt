            Dear Andrew,
 Re marriage gay and straight: of course I can have it both ways. Since there is
 marriage, do I think it should be available to all? Yes! Do I think its social
 and economic benefits might be better distributed in some other way (health
 insurance, for example), are often illusory, come with large helpings of
 inequality, sexism, psychological torment and so on? Yes!

            Is there an anti-family values "left"? Lower Manhattan I give you. But I
 have to laugh when you talk about my "friends at The Nation " as
 anti-family values types. Victor Navasky -- married forever, three children;
 Katrina van den Heuvel, married, one child; Richard Lingeman, another
 supersolid family man; Art Winslow, ditto. John and Sue Leonard, not only
 married but job-sharers, together 24-7. Quick mental glance at the rest of the
 editorial staff--usual collection of urban publishing-industry singles.
 Nobody's even pierced!

            Columnists and writers? Christopher Hitchens, married (to a stay-at-home
 wife no less) with whom he has one child (also two children by a previous
 wife); Pat Williams, single mother of adopted child. Alex Cockburn, well okay,
 maybe he's a bit of a rogue, I give you him too. But as far as personal conduct
 goes, The Nation is probably as conventionally virtuous as any magazine
 in the land. Except for 
                  Slate
               , of course.

            As for ideology, I stick to my contention that family values hold sway
 partout, except in tiny subcultures. Most of the people tagged by the right as
 anti-family values advocates are actually asserting mainstream ideas, like,
 there are many different family forms in contemporary America, working mothers
 are okay, and so forth. But perhaps we should define what we mean by family
 values.

            What do those loaded words mean to you?

            Cheers,
 Katha
