            Went to the Kennedy Center Thursday night to see the Los Angeles Opera's
 production of The Abduction from the Seraglio , which is nearing the end
 of a one-month run.

            Opera is something I know zilch about. Whenever I go, I recall an essay I
 read in college. A Soviet literary critic--either Viktor Shklovsky or Roman
 Jakobson--described ostranenie (or "making strange"). Great art, the
 critic implied, hews (comfortingly) to the familiar, but cultivates states of
 mind that (challengingly) make the familiar fresh. In those days, we budding
 artistes found this doctrine a congenial one, since you could carry it out by
 getting drunk before lectures or going to breakfast stoned.

            But the essay's example was Tolstoy's use of Natasha Rostova in War and
 Peace . At Tolstoy's balls, teas, and operas, even jaded readers get to see
 everything anew--because we see it through Natasha's gushing teeny-bopper
 heart. At balls, Natasha doesn't understand the music and looks at men's faces.
 At teas, she doesn't understand the conversation and concentrates on the cakes.
 At operas, she doesn't understand what's going on onstage and just scans at the
 crowd.

            It's a good point, but it was lost on us, since we were all more or less
 unfamiliar with balls, teas, and operas ourselves. So perhaps I'm just
 extrapolating a generalized boobery out of my own specific ignorance. But
 whenever I go to the opera I feel like I'm in a roomful of Natashas.

            The show-stealer Thursday night was the baritone Gunter Missenhardt as the
 Pasha's sadistic overseer Osmin. He has sung the role in half dozen big
 European houses, and seems made for it--burly and snarly, with a gift for
 violent gesture.

            But for this Washington crowd, the delight was more than operatic. At the
 end of Act 3, Osmin catches the four lovers trying to escape their Turkish
 captivity.
