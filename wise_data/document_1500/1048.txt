 Today 's lead is that the Pentagon office responsible for the safety and
 security of the U.S. nuclear stockpile falsified reports certifying its ability
 to deal with Y2K problems. The Washington Post goes with the finding of American experts
 that Russia's economic crisis has left its stocks of uranium and plutonium
 increasingly vulnerable to theft and diversion. The New York Times
 leads with word that because most states are behind schedule in their attempts
 to eliminate Y2K problems from their computer systems, it's likely that some
 people receiving welfare and other anti-poverty benefits will have their
 payments and/or services interrupted. The Los Angeles
 Times leads with the goings-on at the China/Japan summit in Tokyo
 (which is also fronted by the WP , and carried inside at the NYT ),
 where leaders of the two countries agreed to deeper economic, environmental,
 and social ties, but haggled over the form and wording of Japan's official
 apology for the brutal acts it committed against China during World War II.

            
               USAT says the DOD Inspector General concluded that despite its claims
 to the contrary, the Pentagon's "Special Weapons Agency" never performed the
 required tests on three of its five essential computer systems. Also, it's
 revealed that overall the Pentagon got a "D-minus" grade for its Y2K efforts
 from a House oversight committee. The paper quotes the DOD Y2K czar saying
 nevertheless that "there's very little real mischief going on here."

            The Post lead quotes an American nuclear security expert saying that
 the Russian economy is the world's greatest proliferation
 threat--since the ruble was devalued last summer, the government has
 slashed the salaries of nuclear plant workers and guards, which means not only
 fewer people protecting the nukes but also more people prone to the temptations
 of selling them.
